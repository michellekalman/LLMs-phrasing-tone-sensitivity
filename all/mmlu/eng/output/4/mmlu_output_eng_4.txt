1. To solve \( \frac{5}{8}m = 6 \), we first isolate \( m \) by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{5}{8} \), which is \( \frac{8}{5} \):
   \[
   m = 6 \times \frac{8}{5} = \frac{48}{5} = 9.6
   \]
   Converting 9.6 to a mixed number:
   \[

   - \( \frac{12}{27} \) simplifies to \( \frac{4}{9} \).
   - \( \frac{60}{135} \) simplifies to \( \frac{4}{9} \).
   - \( \frac{4}{9} \) is already \( \frac{4}{9} \).

   The ratio that cannot form a proportion with \( \frac{4}{9} \) is \( \frac{46}{108} \), which corresponds to option A.

Therefore, the answers are:

   x = 24 \times \frac{4}{3} = 32
   \]
   So, the answer is B. 32.

2. To write 4.95 as a mixed number, note that 4.95 can be expressed as \( 4 \frac{95}{100} \). Simplifying \( \frac{95}{100} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5, we get \( \frac{19}{20} \). Thus, 4.95 as a mixed number is \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \).
   So, the answer is A. 4 and 19 over 20.

3. To determine which pair of ratios cannot form a proportion, we simplify each pair:
   - \( \frac{4}{5} \) and \( \frac{24}{30} \) simplify to \( \frac{4}{5} \) and \( \frac{4}{5} \) (proportional).
   - \( \frac{4}{5} \) and \( \frac{20}{25} \) simplify to \( \frac{4}{5} \) and \( \frac{4}{5} \) (proportional).
   - \( \frac{36}{45} \) and \( \frac{4}{5} \) simplify to \( \frac{4}{5} \) and \( \frac{4}{5} \) (proportional).
   - \( \frac{4}{5} \) and \( \frac{20}{30} \) simplify to \( \frac{4}{5} \) and \( \frac{2}{3} \) (not proportional).
   Therefore, the pair \( \frac{4}{5} \) and \( \frac{20}{30} \) cannot form a proportion.
   So, the answer is D. 4 over 5 and 20 over 30.

1. To convert the mixed number 4 and 4/5 to an improper fraction, multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction and add the numerator of the fraction:
   \( 4 \times 5 + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24 \)
   So, \( \frac{24}{5} \).
   Answer: C

2. To find which ratio can form a proportion with 3/8, simplify each option to see if it equals 3/8:
   A. \( \frac{18}{40} \) simplifies to \( \frac{9}{20} \) (not equal to 3/8)
   B. \( \frac{18}{56} \) simplifies to \( \frac{9}{28} \) (not equal to 3/8)
   C. \( \frac{24}{64} \) simplifies to \( \frac{3}{8} \) (equal to 3/8)
   D. \( \frac{15}{48} \) simplifies to \( \frac{5}{16} \) (not equal to 3/8)
   Answer: C

1. To solve \( \frac{5}{8}m = 6 \), we first isolate \( m \) by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{5}{8} \), which is \( \frac{8}{5} \):
\[ m = 6 \times \frac{8}{5} = \frac{48}{5} = 9.6 \]
None of the provided options match 9.6, but let's convert it to a mixed number:
\[ 9.6 = 9 \frac{6}{10} = 9 \frac{3}{5} \]
So, the correct answer is:
D. 9 and 3 over 5

2. A decade consists of 10 years. So, the correct answer is:
B. 10

3. To determine which ratio cannot form a proportion with \( \frac{8}{18} \), we simplify \( \frac{8}{18} \) to \( \frac{4}{9} \). We then check each option:
A. \( \frac{46}{108} \) simplifies to \( \frac{23}{54} \), not \( \frac{4}{9} \).
B. \( \frac{12}{27} \) simplifies to \( \frac{4}{9} \).
C. \( \frac{60}{135} \) simplifies to \( \frac{4}{9} \).
D. \( \frac{4}{9} \) is already \( \frac{4}{9} \).

The ratio that cannot form a proportion with \( \frac{4}{9} \) is:
A. 46 over 108

So, the answers are:
1. D
2. B
3. A
1. To solve the equation \( \frac{3}{4}x = 24 \), you need to isolate \( x \) by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \).

\[
x = 24 \times \frac{4}{3} = 32
\]

So, the answer is:
A. 32

2. To write 4.95 as a mixed number, note that 4.95 can be expressed as \( 4 \frac{95}{100} \). Simplifying \( \frac{95}{100} \) by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 5, gives \( \frac{19}{20} \). Thus, 4.95 is \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \).

So, the answer is:
A. 4 and 19 over 20

3. To determine which pair of ratios cannot form a proportion, check if the cross products are equal:
   - \( \frac{4}{5} \) and \( \frac{24}{30} \): \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \) and \( 5 \times 24 = 120 \) (Equal, forms a proportion)
   - \( \frac{4}{5} \) and \( \frac{20}{25} \): \( 4 \times 25 = 100 \) and \( 5 \times 20 = 100 \) (Equal, forms a proportion)
   - \( \frac{36}{45} \) and \( \frac{4}{5} \): \( 36 \times 5 = 180 \) and \( 45 \times 4 = 180 \) (Equal, forms a proportion)
   - \( \frac{4}{5} \) and \( \frac{20}{30} \): \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \) and \( 5 \times 20 = 100 \) (Not equal, does not form a proportion)

So, the answer is:
D. 4 over 5 and 20 over 30

Therefore, the correct answers are:
1. B
2. A
3. D
1. D

1. To find \( \frac{13}{14} + \frac{7}{14} \), you add the numerators since the denominators are the same:
\[ \frac{13 + 7}{14} = \frac{20}{14} = \frac{10}{7} = 1 \frac{3}{7} \]
So, the answer is:
B. 1 and 3 over 7

2. To find the value of \( 4x + 9 \) when \( x = 4 \):

Your answers are:
1. A
2. C
3. B

These are correct based on the following explanations:

1. **A (there is no cyclical unemployment)** - When a nation is operating at the natural rate of unemployment, it means all unemployment is due to frictional or structural factors, not due to downturns in the business cycle, hence no cyclical unemployment.

2. **C (is inversely related to the price level)** - The domestic purchasing power of a currency decreases as the general price level increases, meaning it can buy fewer goods and services.

3. **B (can be held in a bank's vault or its account at the FED)** - Required reserves are the minimum reserves a bank must hold to back deposits, either in its own vault or in its reserve account at the Federal Reserve; they are not available for lending or investment purposes.

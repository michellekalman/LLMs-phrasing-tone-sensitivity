A northern Indiana pizzeria that closed after its owner said his religious beliefs wouldn't allow him to cater a gay wedding opened Thursday to a full house of friends, regulars and people wanting to show their support. 'It's a relief to get going again and try to get back to normal,' said Kevin O'Connor, owner of Memories Pizza. O'Connor closed the shop for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana. Scroll down for video . Full house: Many customers wait for service as Memories Pizza reopened for business on Thursday. A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours . Owner Kevin O'Connor closed the shop (seen on Tuesday)  for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law . O'Connor, the  61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming . O'Connor said the criticism hasn't changed his beliefs. He said gays are welcome in his restaurant in the small, one-traffic-light town of Walkerton, 20 miles southwest of South Bend, but that he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his Christian beliefs. 'I'd do the same thing again. It's my belief. It's our belief. It's what we grew up on,' he said. 'I'm just sorry it comes to this because neither one of us dislike any of those people. I don't hold any grudges.' A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours.

'I want this to be something that my daughter can enjoy.' Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming. Anger: A protester is seen outside Memories Pizza in this photo with a sign that reads 'Bigots' Uproar: Protesters (like the ones seen here on March 28) have been upset over Indiana passing a new law, which critics said allows businesses the ability to refuse service to gay customers on religious grounds. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana . Family: O'Connor, seen with his daughter Crystal, says gays are welcome in his restaurant, but he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his beliefs . The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. O'Connor says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders . 'We were like, `Stop! Stop! Stop!'" she said. 'It was really making us uncomfortable,' her father said. The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. He says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders. There were no protests as of 7 p.m. Jeanne and Ken Gumm from outside LaPorte, about 20 miles northwest of Walkerton, said they had been waiting for the pizzeria to reopen so they could show their support. 'We couldn't wait to get down here," said Ken Gumm, 66, a tank truck driver. 'To us this whole thing isn't about gay marriage. It's mostly about freedom of religion.'

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today left the door open to a second referendum on Scottish independence before 2020. Before last year's historic vote, Scottish nationalists insisted it was a once-in-a-generation chance to decided on the future of the 300-year-old Union. But Ms Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' In September's vote, 55 per cent of Scots backed the idea of remaining in the United Kingdom. Alex Salmond said the vote was an 'opportunity of a lifetime' and two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: 'We have always said it's a once in a generation thing.' But in a series of TV election debates between Scottish leaders, Ms Sturgeon has shifted her position and today left open the possibility that the promise of another vote could be included in a future SNP manifesto. Under pressure she said that 'something would have to change' before she promised a referendum, and people would have to vote for it. She said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, there is not another referendum on the cards. 'In order for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future, something significant would have to change from the situation we had last year in the referendum.' Ms Sturgeon, who was campaigning in Paisley today, left open the idea of demanding a referendum in next year's Scottish Parliament elections . Opponents claim Ms Sturgeon had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on a referendum, after insisting last year's vote was a once in a generation event . During a fractious and at times shouty debate on BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged her to rule out another vote. Ms Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: 'You clearly don't want to tell people before they vote in this election, what will happen in the next election. 'You have a conference coming up in September, you have 80,000 new members who might be popping along, are you going to put a motion at your conference on this to put a referendum into your next manifesto?' Ms Sturgeon said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, I haven't published the 2016 manifesto. It will be this time next year before we publish the 2016 one.' Mr Rennie said the SNP leader had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on another referendum. He said: 'People need to know whether their vote for the SNP this time round will trigger a referendum in the SNP's manifesto in 2016. Nicola Sturgeon's refusal to answer this basic question makes clear that Scotland faces neverendum. 'It matters because during the referendum we know the SNP took their eye off the ball. As a result, public services were neglected. 'We have seen from Canada the economic impact of an uncertain constitutional environment. Quebec lost jobs and wealth. That damaged the province in the long term. I want a Scotland which builds a stronger economy and a fairer society, balancing the books and delivering more powers.' During a TV debate, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged Ms Sturgeon to come clean on her plans for Scotland . Ms Sturgeon later accused her opponents of 'reviving Project Fear'. The First Minister was questioned about SNP plans to increase Scotland's financial powers, which economists have suggested would leave a £7.6 billion spending gap, during a third televised election debate in under a week. Ms Sturgeon said that full fiscal autonomy would take several years to implement but with new powers Scotland would start growing its economy and revenues. She said: 'This week we've seen the Project Fear that dominated the referendum revived by these three unionist parties, trying to talk down Scotland and assert that we're not capable of running our own affairs.' Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said: 'This (the figure) didn't come from us. You're right in saying this came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It also came from a group of Scottish-based economists that projected the gap to be bigger.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: 'To make this £7.6 billion up Scotland would have to grow at twice the rate of the rest of entire advanced world, so how would you do that Nicola?'

Roughly 1,200 protesters gathered at City Hall on Saturday afternoon, officials said, to protest Gray's death, which has prompted near-daily demonstrations since he died April 19. Gray was arrested one week before that when officers chased him through a West Baltimore neighborhood and dragged him into a police van. However, a smaller group splintered off and looted a convenience store and smashed storefront windows. A protester tossed a flaming metal garbage can toward police officers in riot gear trying to push back the crowd. Earlier, a group of protesters smashed windows of at least three police cars. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a long-time congressman representing Baltimore's 7th District, told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that there is deep frustration over the case. 'Mr. Gray died a week ago. And I think the thing that upset so many people was the fact that here's a young man. We still don't know exactly why he was arrested,' Cummings said. 'We do know that he was hollering out for aid. He was not given aid after being arrested. ... A lot of people are very, very frustrated as to trying to figure out what happened here, and it's very upsetting.'

Police acknowledged Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested — before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the Police Department's policy. Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray asked for medical help several times, beginning before he was placed in the van. After a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.

A volleyball-playing feline was picked to star in a national TV advert after seeing off competition from thousands of gifted animals. Tortoiseshell Mimi became an internet sensation after her owner uploaded clips of her playing the sport to Facebook. The 30-second-video was shared by thousands of people around the world and features the one-year-old cat playing with 15-year-old Joshua Teague. Joshua’s dad Phil, 56, a computer programmer, bought the cat with his wife Christine, 45, when she was eight-weeks-old in December 2013 from a seller who lived in Birmingham. Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert, which was broadcast last Wednesday (15), after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group earlier this month. He said: 'All the family were really excited to see the advert. Mimi the cat appears in a 30-second video showing her unique ball skills . 'We had everyone around so we could watch it together and we told all our friends that it was going to be on. 'I am really proud that our video was chosen out of thousands of entries. 'It was completely by chance that I uploaded the video on to the Pets At Home Facebook page. The cat is seen playing volleyball with 15-year-old Joshua Teague in the hallway . Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group . 'I just saw something on there asking people to share videos and pictures of their pets so that’s what I did. I didn’t even realise it was a competition. 'The video showed Mimi playing volleyball with my son where he would throw the ball at her and she would keep batting it back. 'I had no idea it was competition so I thought it was a joke when I received an email on April 1 saying our video had been chosen for a national commercial. Mimi is seen in the video batting the ball back to Joshua every time he throws it her way . 'This kind of thing just never happens. 'She is a very talented cat. She has done many times since. 'I think she could get her own TV show.' Administrative assistant Christine said: 'I didn’t even know Phil had uploaded the video on Facebook so I thought it was an April Fools’ joke when he told me about it. 'We normally just skip the adverts when we watch programmes but we made sure to watch this one. 'Although she’s only in the advert for a few seconds, it’s nice to see her on it. 'I never thought when I filmed the video that it would end up on TV.'

Controversial Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans is under attack again with experts warning his 'reworked' baby milk formula is dangerous to babies. Dietitians have singled out a 'happy tummy brew' in Evans' cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, because it contains almost five times the maximum vitamin A dose for a baby. The original recipe for the 'brew' contained more than 10 times the maximum daily intake of vitamin A for babies. Scroll down for video . The paleo diet has been one of the hottest diet trends around, with celebrity followers taking on the lifestyle . The Dieticians Association of Australia said the reworked formula still presents a threat to babies. 'This new infant 'brew' could seriously harm babies,' a spokeswoman for the Dieticians Association of Australia told News Corp Australia. 'The authors seem to have made a serious mistake with this second version of their liver and broth recipe, suggesting they do not understand the basic scientific and nutrition information relevant for infant feeding. 'They have said publicly that they have tried to make it safe by reworking the original recipe, and increasing the age for which it's suggested from 0-6 months to now be 6-12 months, but they have failed spectacularly to meet any safe standards.' The paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle . Evans's co-authors, wellness blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padrin, told Channel 7 last week the dangerous formula had been reworked and renamed 'Happy Tummy Brew'. The pair told the program the recipe had changed. 'We added vitamin C and some calcium,'Carr told The Morning Show. It comes after Evans' recently shared two stories on his social media accounts of women who claimed the paleo diet helped alleviate the symptoms of their multiple sclerosis. A 30-year-old woman, Hollie, wrote she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in September 2013. She said that she endured months of  constant dizziness, altered temperature perception, extreme fatigue, numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression. But after jumping on the Paleo diet bandwagon, Hollie claimed she has not suffered any MS symptoms over the past 12 months, her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever. Hollie's experience led the celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000-plus followers on Facebook on Saturday. Pete Evans has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis . 'WOW this is powerful story on MS, thanks for sharing Hollie.. it will make your heart sing.. it has mine, please tag and share wide!' Evans wrote. The Australian chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg, another MS sufferer. The woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on Evans' 10 weeks Paleo program. The celebrity chef has been a proud paleo advocate . 'I have had a lot of health issues the past years, mainly auto-immune stuff including MS,' she wrote in the online post. 'Having MS means I'm always sapped of energy, have numbness, pins and needles, pain, poor concentration, etc. Not any more!' Marg said she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs. 'No way on earth I could have done that 10 weeks ago,' she wrote. 'My concentration and memory is much better and I can also plan better. I'm not off my MS meds yet but I am off my Thyroid and Reflux meds. 'Thanks so much Pete and team for helping me get my life back. You've made this road so easy. As an added bonus I've gone from a size 16 to a size 12.' The My Kitchen Rules judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy. But, Hollie praised Evans for his endorsement of the controversial diet, and said 'the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable'. 'I have been inspired by your encouragement, great recipes and educated by the accurate information you provide,' Hollie wrote. 'Pete, I thank you so very much for bringing paleo in to the mainstream - people no longer look at me as though I'm a weirdo for following this way of life.' In another recent Facebook post, the Australian chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg who also suffers from MS . Evans has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman 'diet' LaTrobe University Associate Professor of Dietetics Catherine Itsiopoulos pointed out Hollie's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the Paleo lifestyle. 'Her diet may have been poor previously,' Dr Itsiopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we don't know what her diet and eating habits were like before. 'By eating lean meat, good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together. 'But we don't actually know if her condition is cured so it's hard to advocate on because there's no scientific evidence to back this up.' The paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar . University of South Australia Professor of Population, Health and Nutrition Kerin O'Dea said while the diet seemed to have worked for Hollie, it might not work for others. 'Pete can share whatever he likes to his followers but there's never going to be one magic bullet to cure an illness or a serious disease,' Dr O'Dea told Daily Mail Australia. 'Someone reporting an anecdote might be true in one person's case but it's very difficult to imply it to others, which can be quite misleading for people. The paleo style of eating, which Pete Evans is a proud supporter of, has been sweeping across the globe . 'They could feel failure when it doesn't work for them, especially when they try to cure a serious condition like this. 'I wouldn't recommend any particular diet for anyone suffering any type of illnesses.' The paleo style of eating, which Evans is a proud supporter of, has swept  the globe and involves a high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruits, seeds and nuts.

(CNN)A popular Chinese television host known for impromptu satire is now the subject of controversy after being caught on camera cursing the late Chairman Mao Zedong. Bi Fujian, who works for state-run China Central Television, was filmed at a dinner party singing a revolutionary song that eulogizes the Communist Party's early years when he started going off script. "The Communist Party, Chairman Mao. Don't mention that old son of a b***h. He made us suffer so bad," went Bi's improvised lyrics. The other dinner guests burst into laughter. Bi later apologized. "My personal speech has led to grave social consequences, and I feel remorseful for that. I hereby sincerely apologize to the public. As a public figure, I shall learn the lesson from this incident, adhering to strict self-discipline," he posted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform. Making disrespectful references to China's leaders in public is considered a taboo in China, even today. And Bi's comment was directed at the man regarded by many as the country's founding father -- despite his controversial reputation. The 75-second video clip, seemingly filmed on the cellphone of another dinner guest, was uploaded on Monday. Since then, it has been removed from video-sharing sites inside China, although it was still accessible on Weibo. It's unclear when the incident occurred, or what the relationsip was between the camera person and Bi. CCTV said it would investigate. "As a CCTV presenter, Bi Fujian's speech in the online video has led to grave social consequences," the network said in a statement posted on its Weibo account. CCTV did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Fondly known as "Grandpa Bi," the 56-year-old TV personality was born and grew up in the Mao era. The song Bi riffed on was part of a "red" Peking opera that was first performed in the late 1950s. It was popularized during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s -- which was launched by Mao -- when China was torn apart by violence and social unrest. The video quickly divided China's online community. Critics said Bi, as an influential public figure, deserved a harsh punishment. But others rushed to his defense, arguing that Bi was simply enjoying himself in a private setting and was set up by whoever uploaded the clip. The video also emerged just a day before the new head of CCTV started his job, leading some to wonder if it were a case of "a new broom sweeps clean." Mao still divides opinion in China. His giant portrait hangs on Beijing's Tiananmen Gate, and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital. But despite this reverence, Mao's is a deeply flawed legacy. Many remember him as a brutal dictator who inspired fear, paranoia and famine, and whose actions resulted in tens of millions of deaths. CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report.

Terrill Wayne Newman (right), who is vying to become Governor of Kentucky, has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after the late local celebrity (left) who bid five times for the title but never won . The newly-christened Galbraith filed paperwork on Wednesday to run as an independent for the state's highest office. The Secretary of State's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by August 11 to get their names on the general election ballot. Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said. Galbraith says he and the late Galbraith were 'not friends per se,' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis. Dea Riley, who was the original Galbraith's running mate in 2011, said she thinks he would find the whole name change amusing. 'I can hear him now: "I'll tell the IRS to send him the tax bill,"' Riley said. But she also said the new Galbraith 'has very big shoes to fill' with his name and she hopes he will honor it. 'To have Gatewood's name and message prostituted, for the sake to garner political office, is a personal affront to me in that I was not only his running mate but equally his friend and confidant,' Riley said.

There looked to be so much bend on Leo Messi’s shot on the half hour at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night that if there had been no net to stop the ball it would kept on curling until it ended up back at the great man’s feet. The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted. Barcelona star duo Luis Suarez (right) and Lionel Messi embrace as Barcelona take a seven-point lead in La Liga . The Barcelona No 10 loses his markers in the Almeria penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike . Barcelona talisman Messi wheels away after opening the scoring  at the Nou Camp during a 4-0 victory over Almeria . Suarez followed Messi's lead by scoring a similar left-footed strike to double the Catalans lead with the first of his two goals . Barcelona defender Marc Bartra stuffs the ball under his shirt after netting a third with a headed goal on 75minutes . Barcelona (4-3-3): Bravo; Alves, Bartra, Mascherano, Adriano; Sergi Roberto, Xavi, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Pedro. Subs: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Mathieu, Pique, Iniesta, Rafinha, Neymar . Booked: Mascherano . Scorer: Messi 33', Suarez 55', Bartra 75', Suarez 90' Almeria (4-2-3-1): Julian; Ximo Navarro, Marin, Trujillo, Casado; Partey, Corona; Wellington Silva (Soriano), Espinosa (Mane), Edgar (Zongo); Bifouma. Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Julián Cuesta in the visitors’ goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Barça number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta’s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo’s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta’s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes.

Brazil full-back Dani Alves rushes to congratulate team-mate Messi after he gives Barcelona a first half lead . The Argentina phenomenon celebrates scoring his 33rd league goal of the season so far . Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria’s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona’s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury. If they don’t do you with the magic of Messi and Suarez then they do you from a dead ball. Almeria had succumbed to all three threats.

Sandra Garratt was in constant agony after undergoing two operations before her death . A grandmother racked with constant pain jumped from the top of a multi-storey car park to end her suffering, her devastated husband has said. Sandra Garratt, 56, went through two years of agony following two back operations for a slipped disc and not even morphine could dull the pain. Last month doctors told the housewife there was nothing more they could do ease her suffering and this was the 'final straw', according to her husband Steve. On Good Friday, the mother of two left her home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after telling her husband she was 'just popping out'. But he became anxious for her welfare and he called the police. At 2.35pm, police and ambulance crews were called to the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, where they discovered Mrs Garratt's body. She had fallen more than 50ft from the top of an Asda supermarket multi-storey car park. Mr Garratt, 57, told how he gave up his job as a community transport driver last year to care for his wife. He said her suffering had intensified in the last 18 months of her life and the pain had spread to her legs, feet and fingers. He added: 'She was in pain every minute of every day. She was a happy lovely person but withdrew from her happy family life. 'Before there had been hope but when there was nothing they could do, it was the final straw. 'Everybody says the same – she is now free from the pain. That's the only bit of comfort. 'The doctors and GPs, within the scope of the NHS waiting lists and everything that goes on, did everything they could.' Mrs Garratt leaves behind daughter Lucy, 37, son Jonathan, 26, and two grandchildren, Joshua and Jessica. The coroner has been informed of her death. Mrs Garratt told her husband she was 'popping out' on Good Friday. Hours later her body was found at the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, West Midlands .

A young Star Wars fan, who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies’ creator George Lucas asking whether he would allow Jedi Knights to marry in the future, was elated to receive a reply granting his request. Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric told Inside Edition: 'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy was on hand to film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son, who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It’s very black and white. There’s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don’t have emotions, but they do. It’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'

The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 at auction. The unique psychedelic cartoon, which is hand-painted, depicts the eponymous submarine from the 1968 film in which the Fab Four travel to Pepperland to save it from the Blue Meanies. The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas, Texas, on Thursday . The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the Yellow Submarine film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The 1968 film starred The Beatles (above) It features handwritten notes instructing artists on the correct colours to use when recreating the submarine. More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch £10,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time. Yellow Submarine was a success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album a year later . The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. The original cel is set to sell for £10,000 . 'It is a film that has stood the test of time and is as relevant today as when it was made in 1968. The Band Concert is the most expensive cel sold . The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported £280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference. 'It would be one of the earliest final versions of the Yellow Submarine hand-painted - it really is the holy grail of Yellow Submarine memorabilia. 'Since small stickers were used for when the sub travelled there are not really a great deal of Yellow Submarine cels out there. 'This comes from a former Yellow Submarine ink and paint department employee. 'It is an unusually large image. Colour model cels were used also to help determine the final approved colour scheme of the yellow submarine. 'Colour model cels from this film are very rare, and this is one of the single best cels of the Yellow Submarine we have seen.' The Animation Art Signature Auction will take place in Dallas, Texas on April 9.

A terminally-ill landlord whose dying wish was to marry his partner of 26 years saw their special day descend into farce after a series of blunders. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home. But, instead of having the magical day they had planned, the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly. Guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over, and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather, 54, after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple's special day (pictured) was full of blunders . Guests at the couple's (pictured) wedding were forced to listen to the song 'Wonderful Life' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on, rendering it invalid . Mr Haigh, who died weeks after the ceremony in November last year, was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he'd let her down. In fact, the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House in the city centre, where the pair said their vows. Mrs Haigh, 54, said: 'Geoff was heartbroken by it all. He kept apologising to me and saying he'd wished we'd got married years earlier and done it properly. 'He was devastated, as the way he saw it, this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness.' The couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once Mr Haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal. However, the landlord of The Ram's Head pub, in Oldham, was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely. The pair then settled upon the Manchester venue as it was not too far from their home. It took three people two hours to get Mr Haigh ready for his big day and, determined to make the day perfect for his bride-to-be, he battled through pain to make it to the venue. Mrs Haigh, 54, said every guest at the ceremony -  held in November last year in Manchester  -  wrote a letter of complaint. She has three marriage certificates (pictured) as the first two were riddled with errors . The couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony (pictured) and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date. An amended version posted later was full spelling errors . However, it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began. They said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down. Then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows, which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar. Mrs Haigh, a mother of three, said: 'There was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after I asked I was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day. Geoff Haigh and his wife Heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day. 'It felt like they were merely using us a practice go, like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them.' After the bride and groom said their vows, guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music 'Wonderful Life' while the registrar went out of the room. Unbelievably, almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before Mrs Haigh was compelled to take action. She said: 'Everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on. We couldn't believe it. 'It had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now.' After the ceremony, as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant San Carlos, the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate. They were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected, otherwise their marriage was invalid. Mrs Haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead. However, when the second certificate arrived in the post, it was addressed to Mrs Haigh in her maiden name 'Taylor' and included spelling errors on the document. A third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple. Mr Haigh (above) passed away in January this year, just weeks after his wedding to long-term partner Heather. The couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year . Mrs Haigh (left) said her new husband (right) was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down. She has received £137 from the Manchester register office following the calamity day . Mrs Haigh said: 'It felt like they didn't recognise we were married and that really hurt Geoff before he died. 'It made if feel like the whole thing didn't happen, like it meant nothing at all. It was devastating. 'The guests were all in tears for us. They were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously.' The newlyweds were offered a £137 refund but Mrs Haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough 'loss' to warrant compensation. She said: 'It wasn't about the money, but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband. 'It was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more. They said "we all make mistakes and we are only human". 'That's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man's dying wish and the most special day of our lives, that attitude is not acceptable.' The wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House (pictured)  in the city centre, where the pair said their vows . The family has since received an apology from Manchester City Council, which runs the register office based at Heron House. A spokesman said: 'I'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs Taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations. 'These types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious. They understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding.' However, tragically, Mr Haigh died on January 4 this year before receiving the apology. His wife added: 'Geoff was determined not to die over Christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come, and he didn't want that for us. The energy it took from him to hang on, I couldn't believe.'

Washington (CNN)This week is the 100th anniversary of what many historians acknowledge as the Armenian genocide -- the Turkish massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians . And it's also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word "genocide" to describe the atrocity. It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word "genocide" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a "genocide" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago . In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. "The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence," he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. "We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians . In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. "No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on," she wrote.

Jailed millionaire Robert Durst pleaded not guilty Tuesday to the newest charge against him - a federal charge of possessing a gun after a felony conviction. U.S. District Judge Lance Africk set a trial date for June 22. Durst is an estranged member of the wealthy family that operates 1 World Trade Center. He also faces a murder charge in California and two state weapons charges in Louisiana - one of possessing a .38-caliber revolver after a felony conviction and one of possessing the firearm along with an illegal drug: about 5 ounces of marijuana. Claiming innocence: Suspected murderer Robert Durst appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to a new charge of gun possession. Pictured above leaving federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana in handcuffs after the court appearance . Durst pleaded guilty to two federal charges in Pennsylvania in 2004: possessing a firearm while a fugitive and while under indictment. However, his lawyers say those convictions don't make it illegal for him to carry a gun under Louisiana law. The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of 55-year-old Susan Berman, a longtime friend -allegedly because she was going to talk to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. He was arrested early March 15, less than 12 hours before HBO aired the final segment of 'The Jinx,' in which - off camera in a bathroom but with the microphone still live - Durst whispers, 'There it is. You're caught!' After about 10 other short sentences and disjointed phrases, he says, 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' Durst was arrested last month on suspicion of the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. The two pictured together above . It's believed that Durst killed Berman because she was about to speak to investigators about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife Kathleen McCormack. Pictured together above . Tuesday's hearing had its own bizarre moment when prosecutor Mike McMahon asked Durst if he understood the maximum penalties he faced if convicted. Durst responded: 'And you are?' Durst's attorney and the judge then explained to him who McMahon was. Durst is being held without bail in a state prison where the Orleans Parish mental ward is located, because the sheriff's office says experts found him a suicide risk. Defense attorneys and prosecutors met with a different federal judge last week to discuss another federal matter: whether two FBI agents and a state trooper on an FBI task force should be held in contempt of court for failing to show up at a hearing last week before the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court magistrate. Federal prosecutors moved that part of the case to federal court Monday; Durst's attorneys have not filed their response and have said they would not comment until they do. Durst's lawyers say his arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the conclusion of 'The Jinx.' Durst had registered at the Marriott under the name Everette Ward and was lying low while HBO aired the final chapter of his life story. Authorities said they found a passport, a head-and-chest latex mask, a handgun and marijuana in his room. His lawyers say it was searched illegally.

A Montana judge who was censured by the state's high court for his comments about a 14-year-old rape victim has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that former state District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors. Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher. Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. At Rambold's August 2013 sentencing, Baugh said Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold, the Billings Gazette reported at the time. Baugh, per the newspaper, described the teenage girl as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth. Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. Scroll down for video . Selected: Former District Judge G. Todd Baugh has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. He sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that a 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher . Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence. Legal case: Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez (right) shared some responsibility for her rape by teacher Stacey Rambold (left) Baugh, who served almost 30 years as a state judge, stepped down last year after being censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days. He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he didn't know who nominated him for the achievement award. He also repeated his assertion that media reports about the rape case had not told the whole story. 'I'm not trying to say I didn't make any mistakes. If you go into all the mistakes that were made, it would give a better-balanced report,' Baugh said. Fehr said Baugh had been nominated for the award by members of the bar association, but she declined to say who that was or why he was chosen. Case: Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence . Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. Baugh later apologized for his remarks. He was also censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days . Marian Bradley, Northwest regional director for the National Organization for Women, said the award was inappropriate given Baugh's conduct on the bench. Regardless of his prior accomplishments, Bradley said the Rambold case cannot be overlooked. 'The last chapter in his career, he put himself out there and did not protect a young girl and did not protect a community,' Bradley said. 'Giving him a lifetime achievement award is going to send people into tailspins.' Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. In December, state District Judge Russell Fagg wrote in a column for the Billings Gazette that Baugh handled more than 30,000 cases in his career. 'He has made thousands of good calls, and a few bad calls, as have all of us,' Fagg wrote. 'Bottom line: Baugh is a wonderful person.'

Kelly Ripa has been grief stricken following the sad news that her friend, cosmetic surgeon Dr Fredric Brandt, was found dead by suicide at his Miami mansion on Sunday. So it's understandable that 44-year-old TV star was looking morose as she left her New York City apartment on Tuesday. The Live With Kelly & Michael co-host, who is usually seen smiling, wore a frown as she left the building alone. When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life.' Sad day: Kelly Ripa looked to be in mourning on Tuesday as she left her NYC apartment; on Sunday it was announced her surgeon friend Dr Fredric Brandt had died . The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice.' The former soap opera actress was dressed casually in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on. The beauty was carrying her coat as well as some papers, a cell phone and her purse. Casual look: The former soap opera actress was dressed down in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on . Feeling the pain: On her show Live With Kelly & Michael, the host told Michael Strahan that she will miss the doctor who had worked on the morning program . Near tears: When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life' Heartfelt: The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice' The day before the New Yorker tweeted her condolences for Dr Brandt, 65, who was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry.  Madonna and Stephanie Seymour were clients. 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer,' the star wrote. Her husband Mark Consuelos, retweeted choreographer Isaac Calpito's post, which read: 'Devastated over the loss of our dear friend @drfredricbrandt. You are missed. You are loved. The world has lost one of its kindest souls.' They were close: Dr  Brandt was remembered by  Ripa (left with the surgeon in 2011) in a tweet on Monday following his tragic suicide at his Miami home on Sunday . Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.' The City of Miami Police Department confirmed that Dr Brandt's death on Sunday was a suicide by hanging. An autopsy was scheduled on Monday, the coroner confirmed. Miami Herald columnist, Lesley Abravanel had said Brandt had been 'devastated' recently over rumors comparing him to a character on the Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Her note: The 44-year-old beauty's tweet said, 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer' Abravanel, a Miami Herald columnist, posted a series of tweets on Sunday claiming that he had been 'devastated' by unflattering comparisons to Dr Franff on the  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, according to  sources close to the doctor. The doctor's longtime publicist Jacquie Tractenberg told The New York Post on Monday: 'The show definitely deeply hurt him, he was being made fun of because of the way he looks. 'It is mean, and it was bullying. But the show was not the reason for his depression, and it was not the reason he would take his own life.' The Tractenberg & Co PR agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. Was he bullied?: Dr  Brandt (left) has a resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly 'devastated' by the portrayal . His colleague, Dr Robert Anolik, who worked with Brandt at his practice, posted a moving tribute on Monday. The acclaimed dermatologist wrote: 'Dr. Fredric Brandt died yesterday. For nearly 5 years, Fred and I worked side by side. He was far more than a colleague to me. He was a close friend. I will miss him every day.' The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami by his housekeeper where he lived alone. She called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. The New York Post also wrote a column last month comparing the real-life doctor to the fictional doctor on Tina Fey's hit comedy. 'Sources: Dr Fredric Brandt was "devastated" over comparisons to the protagonist on Tina Fey’s new Netflix show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt",' Abravanel tweeted. Behar tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed' An eye for art: Dr Brandt, a cosmetic dermatologist and well-known art collector pictured in front of a piece from his collection at his apartment in New York City on March 7, 2014 . Dr Franff only appears in one episode, titled 'Kimmy Goes To The Doctor!', of the first season. The character shares Dr Brandt’s smooth skin, platinum blond hair and enthusiasm for plastic surgery, but his door sign claims he’s a ‘board certified D, DS, DDSOBGYN’, rather than a cosmetic dermatologist. The Dr Franff character is depicted on the Netflix show with a high-pitched laugh and unable to speak certain words due to his plastic surgery. He is also seen drinking  from a surgical bag and reinflates his own face after being punched. Netflix had no comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy.

Moscow (CNN)A Russian TV channel aired Hillary Clinton's first campaign video with a rating stamp that means it's for mature audiences, because of fears it might run afoul of the country's anti-gay propaganda law. A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. "There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't," a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. "Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video)." Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, "I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about." The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that "gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights." Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as "a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia." Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. "I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them," Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). "We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone," he said before the 2014 Games. "That's why you can feel safe and free here," he added, "but please leave our children in peace." The rights group ILGA-Europe said in a May 2014 report that Russia was the worst place in Europe (out of 49 countries) for LGBTI people to live.

Manheim Borough Police Chief Joseph Stauffer told Lancaster Online that the vehicle left the road, flipped over and landed upside-down in a ditch. It was not immediately known who was driving or if the couple had worn seat belts. The top was down when the wreck occurred. Stauffer says there's evidence the vehicle started to skid at a slight left turn, then went off the road and hit an embankment near a barn. The vehicle had been rebuilt or restored, with new elements. 'There are no indicators of what caused the accident yet,' said Stauffer. The investigation continues and Manheim police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

(CNN)A French-language global television network regained control of one of its 11 channels Thursday after a cyberattack a day earlier crippled its broadcasts and social media accounts. Television network TV5Monde was gradually regaining control of its channels and social media outlets after suffering what the network's director called an "extremely powerful cyberattack." In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. On a mobile site, which was still active, the network said it was "hacked by an Islamist group." ISIS logos and markings appeared on  TV5Monde social media accounts. But there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group. As day broke Thursday in Europe, the network had regained the use of one of its 11 channels and its Facebook page, Paul Germain, the chain's editor in chief, told BFMTV, a CNN affiliate in France. However, by late morning, a number of pages on the network's website had messages saying they were under maintenance. The outage began around 8:45 p.m. Paris time (2:45 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. TV5Monde offers round-the-clock entertainment and news programming that reaches 260 million homes worldwide, according to the Ministry of Culture and Communications. It functions under a partnership among the governments of France, Canada and Switzerland, as well as the Wallonia-Brussels Federation. Other networks that provide content to TV5Monde include CNN affiliates France 2 and France 3, France 24 and Radio France International.

A singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner. Captured in a front room in Bahama, North Carolina, the three dogs – a Husky called Sky, a brown and white Springer Spaniel called Sadie and a black and white Springer Spaniel called Marshall – take their positions on their make-shift stage. Getting the tune underway, Sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on Sky’s ear as if whispering something – Sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction. The video begins with Sadie the Springer Spaniel barking and interacting with the Husky named Sky . The Springer Spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the Husky joins it, but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl. Following the Husky’s lead, the Spring Spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another. Meanwhile the other Springer Spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner. No, it's like this! The Husky begins howling, causing the Springer Spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead . All together now! The three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony . Before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl, which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo. The trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder. The howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs – who continue to wag their tails – showing any signs of letting up. No encore? The owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise . Eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying: ‘Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.’ And the three dogs, rather put out about being interrupted, stopping and turning to look at him in surprise.

Kuyt signed a one-year contract with Feyenoord, who are currently third in the top-flight Eredivisie, but said his stay will likely be longer. Kuyt grew into a favorite among Feyenoord's fanatical fans during his first stint with the club from 2003-2006, after transferring from Utrecht. He was the Eredivisie's top scorer in the 2004-2005 season and was named Dutch footballer of the year in 2006. Dirk Kuyt (left) is returning to Feyenoord, nine years after leaving the Dutch Eredivsie club for Liverpool . Kuyt retired from international football in October after finishing third with the Netherlands at last year's World Cup - a tournament where he underscored his versatility by playing on the wing and at left back. He made 104 appearances for the Netherlands and scored 24 goals. He also was part of the team that finished second in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, losing to Spain in the final.

While it might be the nation's largest grocer, Walmart Supercenter was ranked at the bottom of the barrel  in a recent survey of America's supermarkets. The retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in Consumer Reports' annual survey, and this year it was rated number 67, the second worst supermarket. As it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine, Walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce. However, it was noted for its better-than-average prices. Walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in Consumer Reports' annual supermarket survey . The retailer (above a worker in the produce section of a Walmart in Miama) came in at number 67 followed by chain Waldbaum's, which was in last place . 'Every store I go in has room to improve,' said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a statement that the company released to Consumer Reports. 'I can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better. 'And if we nail those, one store at a time, our short-term performance gets better.' The respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness, food quality, freshness and staff courtesy. Walmart was joined by A&P (rated number 66) and Waldbaum's (number 68), which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed, according to CBS. The annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts, which was cited by a quarter of respondents. Other findings included: . Source: Consumer Reports . America's favorite supermarket, taking first place, is New York-based Wegmans. The retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness, baked goods and overall shopping experience. Publix came in second place followed by Trader Joe's, Fareway Stores and Market Basket. Wegmans was also among a total of three grocers, including Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, that earned outstanding produce scores. 'It's going to sound cliché, but our employees are our secret sauce,' Jo Natale, Wegmans' vice president of media relations told Consumer Report. Natale also shed light on the fact that Wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded, which 'allows us to take a long-range view, invest in people, and grow at a controlled rate.' While only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely  satisfied with the quality of their store's produce, meat and poultry offerings; nationwide, Consumer Reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings. Findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including Wegmans, Publix, Costco, Whole Foods and Fresh Market were considered standouts in this category. So as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $5,400 on food, what makes a supermarket the best? The survey noted that those who were the 'freshest' stores were usually the best  overall. Wegmans (file photo above) was rated America's favorite supermarket followed by Publix, Trader Joe's and Fareway Stores . In the past, check out speed and low prices might have satisfied customers, but the survey said they are now also demanding a wider variety of healthy, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. They also want more organics and local produce. 'There's a growing rejection of overly processed and packaged foods, especially among younger consumers,' says Willard Bishop's Jim Hertel. 'They're suspicious about food additives and so sure 'less is more,' that they buy gluten-free even if they're not allergic to gluten.' 1 Wegmans . 2 Publix . 3 Trader Joe's . 4 Fareway Stores . 5 Market Basket (Northeast) 6 Costco . 7 Raley's . 8 Sprouts Farmers Market . 9 Fresh Market . 10 Stater Bros. 11 WinCo . 12 Hy-Vee . 13 H-E-B . 14 Aldi . 15 Whole Foods Market . 16 Fry's . 17 Harris-Teeter . 18 King Soopers . 19 Fred Meyer . 20 Food City (KY, TN, VA) 21 Hannaford . 22 Meijer . 23 Dillons . 24 Smith's Food & Drug . 25 Lowes Foods (NC) 26 ShopRite . 27 Schnucks . 28 Food 4 Less . 29 County Market . 30 QFC . 31 Kroger . 32 Save Mart . 33 Ingles . 34 IGA . 35 Bashas' 36 Marsh . 37 Piggly Wiggly . 38 Tom Thumb . 39 Giant (PA) 40 Cub Foods . 41 Shoppers Food & Pharmacy . 42 BJ's Wholesale Club . 43 Big Y . 44 Ralphs . 45 Target/SuperTarget . 46 BI-LO (GA, NC, SC, TN) 47 Sam's Club . 48 Brookshire's . 49 Vons . 50 Albertsons . 51 Price Chopper (Northeast) 52 Food Lion . 53 Weis . 54 Giant Eagle . 55 Winn-Dixie . 56 Giant (DC, DE, MD, VA) 57 Randalls . 58 Safeway . 59 Jewel-Osco . 60 Stop & Shop . 61 Acme . 62 Pick 'n Save . 63 Tops Markets . 64 Shaw's . 65 Pathmark . 66 A&P . 67 Walmart Supercenter . 68 Waldbaum's . 1 Wegmans . 2 Publix . 3 Trader Joe's . 4 Fareway Stores . 5 Market Basket (Northeast) 6 Costco . 7 Raley's . 8 Sprouts Farmers Market . 9 Fresh Market . 10 Stater Bros. 11 WinCo . 12 Hy-Vee . 13 H-E-B . 14 Aldi . 15 Whole Foods Market . 16 Fry's . 17 Harris-Teeter . 18 King Soopers . 19 Fred Meyer . 20 Food City (KY, TN, VA) 21 Hannaford . 22 Meijer . 23 Dillons . 24 Smith's Food & Drug . 25 Lowes Foods (NC) 26 ShopRite . 27 Schnucks . 28 Food 4 Less . 29 County Market . 30 QFC . 31 Kroger . 32 Save Mart . 33 Ingles . 34 IGA .

We take more photos of ourselves than ever - but it seems selfies are doing little for our self-confidence. Women typically take and delete five pictures before settling on a selfie they feel comfortable posting online, a survey found. And men are happy only on their fourth try. The new survey found women typically take and delete five pictures before they decide they like a selfie . UKIP leader Nigel Farage poses with some young voters while out canvasing in Broadstairs. The survey, carried out by OnePoll, found men are also guilty of taking multiple selfies before they post one they like . Two in three women (64 per cent) feel anxious just having their photo taken, while looking at snaps on social media made 41 per cent feel bad about themselves, according to a survey of 5,000 people by market researchers OnePoll. Of the children who were also questioned, which included 58 per cent who took selfies, 79 per cent said they were happy with the way they looked, 67 per cent thought they needed to look good. ITV's Good Morning Britain show, which commissioned the research, is encouraging viewers to share the first selfie they take on social media under the hashtag #SelfieEsteem. Jamelia, Nicky Byrne, Beth Tweddle, Richard Madeley, Piers Morgan, Nancy Dell’Olio, Rebecca Ferguson are among the celebrities backing the campaign.

A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, "Wow!"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.

(CNN)Thinking about presidential candidates?  Apparently, hormones are a major factor one should consider. According to one female businesswoman in Texas, Hillary Clinton shouldn't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she'll start an unnecessary war. When George W. Bush waged an unnecessary war in Iraq -- was his testosterone to blame? As Cheryl Rios, the CEO of Go Ape Marketing, sees it: "We're built differently, we have different hormones. In the world that we live in, I understand that there's equal rights and that's a wonderful thing and I support all of that. I don't support a woman being president." "With the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war," Rios wrote in a Facebook post. If Rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the Oval Office, she'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president. Throughout history, male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders' decision-making. Studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts. If science doesn't convince you, just Google "cheating politicians" for the long and sordid list of men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Sanford and John Edwards, whose hormones got the best of them. Rios has taken a lot of flak for her "biblically" inspired beliefs, but she's not the only one who's arguing that a woman's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern. Time magazine declared Hillary Clinton the "perfect" age to be president, because she's a postmenopausal woman who is "biologically primed" to lead. (She also happens to be a former first lady, senator and secretary of state.) I'm not joking. Believe me, I wish I were. No wonder Jon Stewart left "The Daily Show" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing. If discussions about a candidate's hormones are what we have to look forward to, the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed. But underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration: The bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015, a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias. We want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything. And you'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college, graduate school and the work force. But what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability, but a bias in how women and girls are viewed. Unfortunately, Cheryl Rios' view of women is not unique. Some people believe women have "our place" and that place is not at the table. They'll tell your daughter to "go for it" but believe she isn't qualified to fulfill her dreams. In a compelling series about women and work, Wharton School professor Adam Grant and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes. The evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless. It's overt: There are more men on corporate boards named John, Robert, William or James than there are women on boards altogether. The bias is also covert: When students rate their favorite professors, they describe the men as "geniuses" and the women as "nice." The bias is real, yet so many of us are blind to it. Hillary Clinton might not be the perfect candidate, but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the White House a much steeper climb. That's not just a problem for Democrats -- it's a problem for Republicans, Independents, everyone. The fact is, equality benefits everyone. It's better for the bottom line (companies with more women in leadership roles make more money).  It's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier, healthier, and more successful. It's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages.  And it's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results. Our nation, our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men. It's not enough to say to our daughters: "You can be anything you want to be." What we need to say is: "You can be anything you want to be, despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong." Rios said that if Clinton is elected, she is "moving to Canada" because "a female shouldn't be president."  Apparently Rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about Canada: Kim Campbell became the country's first female prime minister in 1993. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Canadians elected their first female prime minister, Kim Campbell.

Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after an evening in which their relegation into Sky Bet League One was marked by pre-match supporters' protests against Karl Oyston. Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation . Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen. 'We got off to a flyer and having got back to 1-1 I'm a little bit disappointed we didn't take anything on a horrible night on a horrible pitch.'

Real Madrid have 48 hours to make a decision on Javier Hernandez as the clock runs down on their first option to buy the Manchester United striker. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Monday that the European champions would take stock of Hernandez's situation at the end of the season. However, under the terms set out by United when they loaned the 26-year-old to Madrid, Thursday April 30 marks the end of the Spanish club's 'exclusivity period' to buy the player. Javier Hernandez is enjoying a fine run of form at Real Madrid - scoring three times in his last two games . Hernandez (centre) returned to training with his Real Madrid team-mates on Tuesday . Hernandez (second left) was all smiles in training, but the 26-year-old faces an uncertain future . From Friday they will no longer have first option and United will field offers of around £10million from West Ham, Southampton and Lazio. The Mexico striker who has scored three goals in his last two games has one year left on contract at Old Trafford, but his latest displays have boosted his valuation. Ancelotti said: 'It is a subject that we will evaluate at the end of the season. What I can say is that I have liked his professionalism during the whole year. He is enjoying his opportunity a lot, he has a high level of professionalism and for a coach to have these type of players that are always ready is very positive.'

(CNN)People magazine has anointed Sandra Bullock the world's most beautiful woman of 2015, the publication revealed on Wednesday. Bullock, 50, joins a long line of actresses to receive the honor, including last year's cover girl, Lupita Nyong'o, and Gwyneth Paltrow in 2013. She seems to be taking it all in stride, calling the whole thing "ridiculous." "Real beauty is quiet. Especially in this town, it's just so hard not to say, 'Oh, I need to look like that,' " she told People. "No, be a good person; be a good mom; do a good job with the lunch; let someone cut in front of you who looks like they're in a bigger hurry. The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying." The cover story focuses on Bullock's home life with her son, Louis, 5, and her efforts to stay healthy and fit past her 40s. "I was putting him to bed and told him that even when I'm old and gray and more wrinkly than I am now, I'll still love him and want to tuck him in," she said. "And he asked why I have wrinkles, and I said, 'Well, I hope some of them are from laughing so much.' And he touched my face and said, 'You're not old, you're just happy.' " The Oscar-winning star of movies including "Gravity," "The Blind Side" and "Crash" said she's happy with who she is. "As long as I'm healthy and strong and I don't let this mind of mine run amok with insecurities about what I am not, I can look in the mirror and like who I see." The selection of Bullock, the oldest woman to receive top honors in the history of the list, is a sign that beauty knows no age, say some. "Great choice! Gorgeous, talented, over 50 and FABULOUS! That's the way it's done!" wrote one fan on People's Facebook page. Also making the "most beautiful" cut this year: Gabrielle Union, Ariana Grande and Laverne Cox. The issue hits newsstands Friday.

'This is not selfie time,' Wesley said jokingly. 'Let the brother worship in the house of God.' Churchgoers traditionally walk around to shake hands and give hugs during the greetings and announcements portion of service, but the pastor encouraged the crowd to stay in their seats and greet only their closest neighbors, as the sanctuary was tightly secured with Secret Service agents.

'You either believe it or reject it.' Wesley said the sacrifices of Christ allowed the congregation to be forgiven for their own sins. 'He took the pain for me. I owe him my life. I owe him my praise. I owe him my hallelujah,' he said.

Jane Tipper had been walking her dog Molly when the eight-year-old chased a lamb over a cliff . A Border Terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall after chasing a spring lamb off the edge of  a cliff before spending three days stranded on a remote beach. Dog Molly had been on a walk with owner Jane Tipper and her daughter Hannah in Eype, Dorset, last week when the she fell over the cliff's edge along with the lamb. Molly survived a vertical drop of 100ft then rolled 150ft down a steep slope and coming to rest in gorse near the bottom. Her distraught owners managed to see that the eight-year-old had survived the drop, but had no way of getting down to the beach to get her. A team of ten coastguards arrived on the scene and a winchman was lowered down the cliff face but was unable to find her despite four hours of searching. Ms Tipper, who had been celebrating her 64th birthday, was forced to return home in nearby Charmouth without her beloved dog which she has had since she was a puppy. She contacted the website DogLost which arranged for missing posters to be put up in the area. Three days later, Molly was found in an exhaustive state after walking a mile further along the beach to an area popular with dog walkers. It is unclear what had happened, but luckily, she has come through her ordeal relatively unscathed - but there has been no sign of the lamb since the incident. Ms Tipper said: 'I was with my daughter, it was my birthday and we planned a short walk and lunch in a local cafe but we never got there. The border terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall, including a 100ft vertical drop, in Eype, Dorset, but her owner had no way of reaching her. Coastguards searched thoroughly but were unable to find her . 'Molly's usually very good, she doesn't chase animals. 'She fell about 200ft but the cliff was on a slight slope. I couldn't see her at the bottom but my daughter did so we knew she survived the drop. 'The coastguard winched one of them over the cliff and he went from side to side looking for her but couldn't see her. 'It's rocky there, there's thick patches of gorse and it's extremely dangerous. 'After a couple of hours they said they just couldn't spot her. They were very upset about it.' She added the incident left her 'completely numb'. 'We didn't stop searching at the end of the day,' she said. 'When I got home I phoned as many people as I could think of.' But fortunately, a female dog walker recognised Molly from the lost posters that had been put up in the area on Friday. After Ms Tipper put up missing dog posters, Molly was identified by a dog walker three days after going missing. Pictured right, the cliff face in Dorset where Molly fell . Ms Tipper added: 'The lady was walking her dogs when Molly followed her and sat next to her. She called me and we met up and fortunately it was Molly, I was worried it was going to be someone else's dog. 'Molly was very pleased to see me, especially when I got a gravy bone out of my pocket. 'She wasn't hurt or limping or anything, but she was shattered and spent the rest of the day asleep when we got home. 'I think it's really knocked the stuffing out of her. ' A coastguard spokesman urged dog owners to always keep their pets on lead while walking near the coast.

Early Thursday he committed suicide, his sister Madylin Sweeten said in a statement. He was 19. "This morning a terrible family tragedy has occurred," Madylin Sweeten said in a statement passed on by her manager Dino May. "We are devastated to report that our beloved brother, son, and friend, Sawyer Sweeten, took his own life. He was weeks away from his 20th birthday.

Sawyer Sweeten was born in May 1995 in Brownwood, Texas. He was a year and a half old when he started on "Raymond," playing next to his real-life twin brother Sullivan, who starred as Michael Barone, according to the website IMDb.

According to his IMDb profile, Sawyer did not appear to take on acting roles after "Raymond" was discontinued. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.

It's just thoughts going through my mind. It will all become clearer in the coming weeks,' he told Sky. United are reportedly willing to offer Dortmund up to £30million to sign Hummels, who may be tempted to move in search of Champions League football. Mats Hummels (right) has admitted he is considering his future at Borussia Dortmund . The Germany defender has consistently been linked with a big-money move to Manchester United .

A video showing a man cracking a giant egg to reveal another fully formed egg inside, may be enough to scramble your brain. YouTube user Elman511 cracked open the over-sized egg that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ While the instance is extremely rare, it’s caused when the hen is in the process of forming an egg in her oviduct and another oocyte – the ovum or egg cell that becomes the yolk of the egg – is released too soon. Scroll down for video . Egg-traordinary: US YouTube user Elman511 cracked open an over-sized egg (shown on the left) that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ In the video, Elman511 cracks the egg, which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. He then cracks the smaller egg, which also has a yolk and white inside. ‘That’s the end of the nesting dolls of egg…an egg inside of an egg… crazy man,’ he said, before noting that the yolks look rich. Egg-citing: In the video, ‘Elman511’ cracks the egg (pictured), which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. The unusual occurrence is down to a counter-peristalsis contraction . This is when a second oocyte (yolk) is released by the hen's ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The unusual occurrence is called a counter-peristalsis contraction. A hen releases an oocyte from her left ovary into her oviduct every 18 to 26 hours, Back Yard Poultry Mag explained. Usually, the oocyte travels down the oviduct, adding layers of the egg until it’s laid through the hen’s vent. But in a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The phenomenon has been mentioned as far back as 1250 AD by the Dominican friar and polymath Albertus Magnus in his book De Animalibus. Ask the egg-spert: In a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. This results in an egg with another made inside it, producing two yolks (pictured)

(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for "lost" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the "holiday" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the "mistake" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the "war on women" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious "war on women" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The "war on women" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the "war on women" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative "solution" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.

Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge . A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman . 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'

An investigation has concluded Freddie Gray broke his neck after falling head-first into the back of the police van as it was moving, it was reported today. Medical and law enforcement sources briefed on the police investigation told ABC News Gray's 'catastrophic' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt 'in the back door of the van'. They claimed there was 'no evidence' Gray sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest, which was caught on camera on a street side on April 12. According to ABC's sources, Gray was standing in the van, bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door. It is believed he fell into the door, breaking his neck. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A report claims Freddie Gray broke his neck when he fell head-first into the back of the van as it was moving . Similar van: Freddie Gray was stood, bent over, with his head facing the back door of a van like this . Timeline? It is believed Gray fell head-first into the back of the van, breaking his neck, during the journey . Inside: The above diagram shows the inside the police van . Pictured: The second stop which police failed to report in their paperwork after the van journey, during which Freddie Gray sustained a 'catastrophic' head injury. It was picked up by a privately-owned security camera . According to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray . The news comes hours after Baltimore Police admitted the van transporting Gray made a previously unreported stop. The mysterious detail was picked up by a privately-owned security camera, and will be integral to the police investigation into Gray's death, which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on Thursday morning. It is not known why the van stopped at the corner of North Fremont Ave and Mosher Street before it made another two stops then finally transported Gray to the hospital. And police have yet to clarify why Gray would have been standing without a seat belt on. Just nine days before his arrest, the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy, making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van. Revelation: Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop. He refused to elaborate on the details of the new information . Police Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to elaborate on the new information. He said the contents of the report, which was completed and handed to the State Attorney at 8.50am Thursday, will remain confidential as they continue to investigate. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested. The report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver, who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators, according to ABC. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton. As the police department, Mayor's office, and state prosecutors refuse to address the development, it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of Gray's arrest more than two weeks ago. A relative of one of the suspended police officers told CNN she believes Gray was injured during his arrest outside the van. Her family member, she said, was based inside the van, and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he 'didn't do'. However, this theory is at odds with the medical examiner's report which allegedly found Gray sustained injuries by falling over inside the van, where he had been placed without a seat belt. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN her family member was in the van with Gray as he screamed and cried for medical help. But she believes the spinal injury which led to Gray's death was inflicted earlier, during his arrest on April 12. In an appeal that echoes Gray's family, she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow. 'Six officers did not injure this man,' she told Don Lemon. Secret stop: This is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stop . These are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stop . Jung Hwang's convenience store's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting Freddie Gray . 'Six officers didn't put him in the hospital. 'I'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did, that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.' Her words came after a police document was leaked to the Washington Post, in which the other prisoner in the transport van with Gray said he could hear the 25-year-old slamming himself against the wall. The prisoner speculated that Gray was trying to hurt himself. In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'. However, he admits he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton . The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family. 'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we've seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' Outrage over the unexplained death of a black man in Baltimore, Maryland prompted nationwide protests against police brutality on Wednesday from Houston to Boston. Baltimore has been the scene of near-nightly protests ever since the April 19 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who is believed to have been fatally injured while in police custody. State Attorney Marilyn Mosby urged the public to be patient as she reviews the information. 'While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,' Mosby said on Thursday. 'We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.' Freddie Gray: The 25-year-old was poisoned by lead paint as a child growing up in Baltimore . Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west side . Nicknamed 'Pepper', he was described by an ex-girlfriend as happy-go-lucky with an infectious sense of humor. The Baltimore police knew him, however, as a 5ft-8ins felon who had notched up at least 18 arrests and a handful of convictions - mainly for Class A drugs but also burglary, assault and illegal gambling. He was said to have set off running at the sight of police patrolling a well known open-air drug market. He was taken into custody for possession of a switchblade and during transport to the station he experienced what officers described as 'a medical emergency'. Gray, who had asthma, requested an inhaler and had trouble breathing in the van, but police didn't provide his inhaler. According to Gray's family his spine was severed 80 per cent at his neck, three vertebrae were fractured and his larynx was injured. Court papers describe Gray's childhood as problematic. He lived with his heroin-addicted disabled mother in a home in Sandtown-Winchester that contained enough poisonous lead in the peeling painted walls and windowsills for a court settlement to conclude that he and his two sisters were incapable of leading normal functioning lives. Lab tests conducted in the 1990s showed that they had levels of lead in their blood nearly double what the state of Maryland defines as the minimum for lead poisoning. In Baltimore, more than 2,600 children have been found to have high levels of lead in their blood, according an annual report released by the Maryland Department of the Environment in 2014. 'This is the toxic legacy of lead-based paint,” Ruth Ann Norton, head of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative and a founding member of the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission, told the Baltimore Sun. 'Our kids are ill equipped to stay in the classroom, finish school. They’re very unlikely to go on to higher education. They’re less likely to be able to hold a job', she said. 'They’re less equipped to be able to overcome the poverty and other circumstances that pull them down. Children with lead poisoning will have defects, regardless of whether their parents are ‘nice’ or not.' Gray lived off the resulting 'lead check' settlement although it is unclear exactly how much he received. Whatever money he did have he was said to spend buying designer accessories. The Sandtown neighborhood is a 72-block neighborhood made up of almost entirely of African Americans. More than one-third of residents live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter are unemployed. The majority of Maryland's state prison population are said to said to hail from Sandtown, according to the Justice Policy Institute.

Screeching around the track in a car he last drove more than 50 years ago, Sir Stirling Moss appears to have lost none of his racing pedigree. And at 85, the man widely seen as history's greatest all-round racer has revealed the unusual daily routine he thanks for his impressive longevity – 77 press-ups and half a bottle of Chardonnay. Sir Stirling, who won 212 races in his 14-year career, also spoke about how he has swapped the high-octane vehicles of his heyday for a tiny electric car that has a top speed of just 50mph. Reunited: Sir Stirling Moss sitting behind the wheel of the refurbished Austin-Healey Sprite . Success: The 85-year-old won 212 races during his 14-year career before a crash at Goodwood in 1962 . Back in action: Sir Stirling examines the refurbished car alongside Car SOS presenter Fuzz Townshend . Speaking to The Daily Mail, Sir Stirling said he sees fitness as a 'way of life' which is why he is still so confident behind the wheel. However, never one for strenuous gym sessions, he puts his health down to more unusual methods. He said: 'I have half a bottle of wine a day, which fits in very nicely, and that's it. I do what I call lady press ups and I do 77 a day. 'It's not as difficult as it sounds because I do them from a kneeling position. I could not do 70 press ups like I could when I was 30 years old. 'I've broken various bones during my career so I'm not that flexible. I think staying fit is a way of life more than anything else really.' When it comes to diet, he said he believes in indulgence and never denies himself something he wants. He said: 'I never go to bed hungry, let's put it that way, especially as Susie is such a fantastic cook. Car SOS sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. Above, Sir Stirling with presenters Fuzz Townshend and Tim Shaw . Sir Stirling drove the refurbished car in 1962 - one month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career (pictured above). He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks . 'I allow myself whatever I want but I would have to say my indulgences are that Susie and I drink one bottle of wine each day, white certainly, Chardonnay. And chocolate. I'm trying to cut that down but not that successfully.' He made the revelations after a new documentary reunited the father-of-two with the Austin-Healey Sprite he used as a training car before the 1962 Sebring three-hour race. The race took place a month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career. He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks. He returned to the cockpit a year later but decided against competing professionally as he felt he was no longer driving instinctively. The Austin-Healey Sprite was also used by the rest of his team, including Hollywood star Steve McQueen and racing legends Innes Ireland and Pedro Rodriguez. Car SOS, which broadcasts on the National Geographic Channel on Thursday, sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. While he found fame hurtling around corners at death-defying speeds, Sir Stirling now takes a more measured approach to the road. For the last 18 months he has been driving a Renault Twizy, an electric car with a top speed of 50mph. He said of the car, which retails for less than £7,000: 'I live right in the middle of London, right by Hyde Park Corner, and the limitations on an electric car like that, you don't notice them. 'If I lived outside the North Circular there might be times when I'd think "Crickey, I wonder if I'll make it back on the charge" but having said that, the Twizy is just the sort of car to have around London. Sir Stirling has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. Above, the couple at Silverstone in July 2011 . 'It is absolutely very different to the cars I used to drive. There are certainly good reasons to have a petrol car but living where I do, in the centre of London, I can't think of anything better than what I have got.' Sir Stirling, who was knighted in 2000, said he would not want to be a professional driver today because he thinks there are too few races. He said: 'It's quite different now though, they only do 18 races a year, I was doing 52 because I would go down to Australasia in the winter or Malaysia or South Africa and do all types of racing. ' It's so different now that you can't compare the life of a driver then and now. It's unfortunately one of those things that has moved on and I don't think will ever be able to move back.' He has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. He added: 'If your wife is your best friend that's the important thing to me. If every decision you think about or make or take you discuss with her first, I think that's very important. 'But then Susie says I do what I want anyway.' Car S.O.S. broadcasts on Thursday April 9 at 8pm on National Geographic Channel.

The police officer accused of murdering Walter Scott will be banned from seeing his first-born child for several months, it was revealed today. Patrol officer Michael Slager will be refused the right to hold the baby which his wife Jamie is set to give birth to in a few weeks. He is only granted video access to his eight and a half month's pregnant wife and an officer stands outside the booth whenever he talks to his family. They are not allowed to spend any time together and contact is via video screens with headphones at the Charleston County jail. But the baby will not be able to enter the South Carolina prison. Before the fall: Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, with his wife Jamie before his arrest. Slager was charged with murder after shooting Walter Scott, 50, after stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina . Visit: Michael Slager received a visit at Charleston County Jail last Friday from his pregnant wife and mom . It is deemed unsafe for an infant to enter the prison so Slager will have to rely on photographs as cell phones and access to the internet is forbidden. He will be informed by a telephone call and have to wait to see photographs, which will be examined by officials before being presented to him. When Jamie attended the jail on Friday, she was made to turn through the prison's reception area and take a seat next to a video screen for a talk with him which lasted around two hours. The booths are protected by screens to prevent onlookers from seeing inmates, but appointments have to made in advance. Relatives of other prisoners queued to use the video booths after registering with prison officials behind thick glass security screens as Jamie and her accused husband talked with the aid of headphones. But their first child together will not be allowed to visit him in prison until jail chiefs decide that the baby's health would not be at risk from being there. Although there is no specific age limit, prison policy is not to allow babies in. No date has yet been set for his first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away. Major Eric Watson of the Charleston County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online: 'He is treated just like any other prisoner, except for being in protective custody. 'His baby won't be coming to the prison and he will not be allowed to see the child. It could be several months before he does. 'His attorney can apply for the baby to be brought to the jail if he wants.' Walter Scott was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen. Family tell says the light was an accessory and both mandatory stop lamps were functioning . Slager, 33, already has two step children from his wife's previous marriage, but the new baby will be the first for him and Jamie. Major Watson said Slager had no access to the internet and was under close scrutiny to deter any threat from angry prisoners over the shooting of Walter,who was gunned down by the officer after being stopped for an apparent faulty tail light on his Mercedes. Walter's supporters and family say he was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen and this was wrong because the light was an accessory and both his obligatory stop lamps were functioning. Major Watson said Slager was being offered three meals a day and recreation time, but was isolated from other inmates. Housed in a room with one small window, he has no interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail. One released prisoner said outside the gates: 'Man, it ain't no holiday being in there. He has to watch his back more than most because of what he did. There's a lot of angry men in there, black and white.' Walter's brother Anthony said police faced 'many questions' about traffic stops based on racial profiling and that his brother's death should serve as a catalyst for a change in police policies. Meanwhile, the man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton. No date has yet been set for Slager's first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away . The mystery man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton . The 30-year-old was detained by police as Walter fled his Mercedes Benz before dying in a hail of bullets and later released. Pierre's family said they had no idea why he was in the car and how he came to be friends with the shooting victim. His grand mother Eunice Fulton, 70, said: 'I spoke with my daughter Franetta on Thursday and Pierre had only just told her he was in the car. 'It was a terrible incident but we haven't had the chance to speak to him about it. He used to live with me until a couple of years ago. But I don't where he hangs out now. He moves around.' Pierre, who was known to police, had stayed in the background since Walter was shot by officer Michael Slager and at the weekend rejected media requests for interviews. He has given a full statement to investigators, but police refused to reveal his name and what he has told them. He had requested privacy. Pierre was caught on the policeman's dash cam after Walter had fled and been shot. But police released him without charge and he was not suspected of any crime. He has convictions for unlawfully carrying a pistol and served 174 days in prison in 2005 and has been arrested several times. His grandmother added: 'He is a good grandson. He cares for his family. But I don't know what he is doing now.' Pierre has worked as a cleaner, laundry man and warehouseman over the years, but some members of his family have lost touch with him. Rosanne Grant of Alternative Staffing employment agency told Daily Mail Online: ' He worked at various jobs over the period of a year through me. The last time I hear about him was in 2006 and nothing since. I don't know what he has been working at.'

The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was ‘no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident’. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had ‘existed for some time prior to the accident’. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell’s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.’

Sunderland are trailing former Wigan striker Franco di Santo. The Argentine is playing for Werder Bremen and has scored 13 goals in 22 games this season. The Bundesliga side want £8million for the 26-year-old who Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton knows well from his time at Chelsea. Sunderland are considering a summer move for in-form Werder Bremen forward Franco Di Santo . The Argentine has been in superb form for his club this season, netting 13 goals in 22 games . Di Santo began his senior career with Chilean side Audax Italiano in 2006, before catching the Blues' eye two years later. However, he failed to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and following a similarly ineffectual loan spell at Blackburn Rovers, was sold to Wigan in 2010. He spent three seasons with the Lancashire-based outfit, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances. Di Santo was an unused substitute during the club's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2013, before being released at the end of that season. He made the move to the Bundesliga in August 2013 and has appeared to fulfil some of his early promise. Di Santo previously played for Chelsea but struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and was sold . Di Santo played for Wigan for three seasons, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances before being released .

(CNN)Roseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: "My vision is closing in now," she said. "I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up." Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making . Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) "It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of," explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. "Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision," Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy . Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk . Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . Eat your greens . Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries . Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke . While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.

Eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements, a study has claimed. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.

Jessica Silva has spoken about why she had to kill her abusive husband and revealed she hopes his family can one day forgive her for what she did. In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' On Sunday night, Jessica Silva speaks publicly for the first time about the day, Mother’s Day 2012, when she stabbed and killed her partner, the father of her young son. Last month she walked free from court, despite being convicted of manslaughter, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all. Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica’s parents). He revealed to Michael Usher that the ordeal had so destroyed Jessica that 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I didn't recognise her' Jessica Silva admits she was living in fear and violence and she told no one. 'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' 'During the interview she gets to the point where she reveals "my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness". 'I don't know if there will ever be a neat ending. 'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, "you're fat, you're ugly", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . 'On that fateful night, Jessica made a split-second decision to save herself and her family,' according to the 60 Minutes program. 'Jessica opens up about her life with Polkinghorne and recounts what happened the night that ended in his death.' 'I didn't realise that she was going to be as raw as she still was,' Usher added. 'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how "I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.' See the full story on 60 Minutes at 8.30pm on Nine tonight .

(CNN)A 32-year-old Massachusetts man is facing murder charges, authorities said Wednesday, four days after another man's remains were found in a duffel bag. The Middlesex District Attorney's Office said that Carlos Colina, 32, will be arraigned the morning of April 14 for murder in connection with the remains discovered Saturday in Cambridge. Earlier this week, Colina was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. A Middlesex County judge then revoked bail for Colina in another case he's involved in, for alleged assault and battery. The victim in that case is different from the one whose remains were found in recent days. Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. "This was a gruesome discovery," District Attorney Marian Ryan said. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.

Fired: Major General James Post III was fired on Friday after making a treason comment . An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane. A-10 retirement: The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the A-10,  low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support . The inspector general's investigation interviewed several witnesses who remembered Post using the word 'treason' to describe efforts to oppose the Air Force leadership's decision to retire the plane, either via a social media campaign or by talking to Congress. In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.' General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander. Post issued an apology on Friday and said he did not intend to try to prevent people from talking to lawmakers. Handed in a latter: General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander .

Ukip candidate Kim Rose (pictured handing out sausage rolls today) is being investigated by police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls . A Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event, which also saw veteran snooker player White play pool with local youngsters. Mr Rose, a jeweller, said he was oblivious until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. Laughing off the allegations, he said: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes. 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties. 'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 'He said, "it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.' Mr Rose, who will now have to report to a police station on Monday, added: 'It was a fantastic day. We laid on teas, coffees, sandwiches and some sausage rolls. 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.' Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right) branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll' Today Mr Rose was seen out in Southampton handing out sausage rolls to members of the public . He said: 'The Ukip support is very strong here and I feel the main political parties will do anything they can to scrutinise everything about us.' Mr Rose added that if other politicians fear voters could be 'bribed with sausage rolls', perhaps it is not surprising they will not trust the country with a referendum on EU membership. Today the parliamentary candidate was out campaigning on the streets of Southampton, handing out sausage rolls to members of the public. Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, backing Mr Rose. He said: 'I think it’s utter nonsense. There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions. 'Having a few sausage rolls I don’t really think counts as one of those.' Mr Rose said the event, which was attended by 250 people, took place at a community centre in Southampton on February 21 - more than a month before Parliament was officially dissolved. He invited veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, who he described as a long-time friend. The former world number two and six-time World Champion, nicknamed 'The Whirlwind', played pool with residents, who were charged £2 to attend the event. 'I've known Jimmy as a friend for a number of years and so I asked him to come down and play pool with the kids,' Mr Rose said. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. 'I didn't want to make the event very Ukip so we put all the party banners away and everybody had a game of pool with Jimmy.' The Electoral Commission said the pastry provision was a police matter. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We have a received an allegation of "treating" by a prospective parliamentary candidate, contrary to the Representation of the People Act 1983. We are looking into the complaint. No arrests have been made.' Electoral Commission rules on treating state: 'A person is guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting. 'Treating requires a corrupt intent - it does not apply to ordinary hospitality.' Anyone found guilty of treating can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. Mr Rose has been a member of Ukip since 1999. He briefly stood as an independent in the key marginal Southampton Itchen seat in 2010 before pulling out. He is campaigning on tackling deprivation in Southampton, as well as wanting to pull the UK out of the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron came under criticism in the constituency earlier this week after sending a letter to residents spelling the constituency's name wrong three times. His letter, which has his letterhead and signature, had 'Itchen' spelled as 'Itchin', prompting the Conservatives to apologise for the embarrassing mistake. The constituency's MP has been Labour's John Denham since 1992. He held the seat in 2010 by just 192 votes and is standing down after May 7.

But police tapping his phone during an investigation heard him tell his then wife Nina: 'Yes, it's true, I ruin lives, I am a piece of s*** and I don't even feel guilty any more.'

A husband was left so traumatised by his wife's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock, despite his wife already being given a hefty payout. In a case which could have huge financial consequences for the NHS, Julie Ronayne was awarded £160,000 after she was left 'looking like Michelin man' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008. Her husband Edward, who lives with Mrs Ronayne in Netherley, Liverpool, was awarded £9,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife's appearance. Edward Ronayne was given £9,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up 'like Michelin man' after botched surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital (pictured) The severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis, which the woman had contracted during the surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation. The test case, being heard at London's Appeal Court, could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an NHS mishap. Mr Ronayne was awarded the damages from Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust in July 2013. Liverpool County Court heard how he had been a 'secondary victim' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife's new appearance. He had described her 'colloquially as looking like a Michelin man', the court heard. Mr Ronayne also described his wife's first two days in hospital as 'the worst days of my entire life'. He said he had been 'brought up not to complain' but had never fully recovered from the sight. He added that he had been left feeling tearful, overwhelmed, angry and powerless. The judge, who described him as 'an honest and reliable witness', said: 'His symptoms...were pathological and went beyond simply the distress and anger that a man would suffer due to the near terminal illness of his wife.' But in the appeal court today, Charles Cory-Wright QC, who represents the health trust, told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury. He said Mr Ronayne's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims, costing the cash-strapped NHS millions in compensation. The barrister argued that Mr Ronayne would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation. He added that he was visiting his wife in hospital and therefore would have expected her to look unwell. He told the court: 'Hospitals on a day-to-day basis deal with people who are ill or vulnerable. They go there followed by their loved ones. It is unfortunately a matter of day-to-day occurrence that great emotional responses will take place in a hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if Mr Ronayne is allowed to keep the money. The test case is being heard at the appeal court . 'The question arises more and more often in cases like this as to whether those relatives have a claim.' Stressing the importance of the appeal, he told the judges: 'This appeal is not just about this case, but the concerns NHS Trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place. Peritonitis is caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the stomach. It is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, which can rapidly spread around the body. Peritonitis requires immediate treatment and is a medical emergency. Most cases of peritonitis are the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix or digestive disorders. Peritonitis can be fatal and needs to be treated quickly to avoid such complications. Source: NHS . 'The effect of this judgement, if it stands, is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases, as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock. 'Often emotional illness follows, but there is not the necessary element of shock. There needs to be a suddenly shocking event which, because of its shocking nature, causes that psychiatric illness. That is often lost in the wash in these cases.' But Lord Justice Sullivan said the incident had no doubt been 'shocking' 'Simply going into hospital and seeing one's loved ones and family looking peaky is not enough,' he said. 'But to see one's wife looking like the Michelin man is shocking.' Mr Cory-Wright then replied: 'If you saw your loved one looking like the Michelin man, swollen and all that, it would be shocking in an ordinary sense. 'But it would not be shocking in the sense of being suddenly overwhelmed so as to lead to psychiatric injury.' The judges recognised the importance of the case by reserving their decision on the trust's appeal until a later date. The case was heard in front of Lord Justice Sullivan, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Beatson. Mrs Ronayne went on to make a good recovery.

John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United with thousands of supporters planning to boycott Sunday's home match against Spurs. The 50-year-old has found himself the target of angry fans who are disillusioned with Mike Ashley’s running of the club. Results on the pitch – they have lost five on the spin - have not helped Carver’s cause, but the problems at Newcastle run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad. John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United . United’s supporters will protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from billionaire Ashley, especially as the Magpies have returned record profits of £18.7million and this week revealed they also have £34m sat in a bank account. Carver is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer – or deflect – questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis, distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul. But as reported by Sportsmail last month, senior sources within St James’ Park have indicated that Derby boss Steve McClaren will take over in the summer, regardless of whether or not the Rams are promoted from the Championship. On Tyneside, however, he will inherit what Carver believes is the toughest task in the land: ‘I think it is the hardest job in football, definitely,’ he said. Steve McClaren has already been tipped as a replacement for Carver should he face the Newcastle axe . ‘For me, this is the dream job, but you love it and hate it at the same time. ‘The hardest thing is taking the criticism off your own people. Some of it is deserved and some of it is not. ‘Sometimes you’re dealt the hand and you’ve got to get on with it and this is the hand I’ve been dealt. ‘When I took it on, if I hadn’t accepted then I would have been kicking myself. ‘And I’ve said this before, I genuinely believe that if I’ve got the right tools I can do the job. ‘But it is bitter sweet at the moment. This job is definitely a rollercoaster.’ Website AshleyOut.com are co-ordinating Sunday's planned boycott. They will protest outside of the Gallowgate End before kick-off and after the game. During the match they will go to Leazes Park behind the stadium. Carver, though, has urged fans to get behind the team. Fans are unhappy at how Newcastle are being run under Mike Ashley and have planned a boycott . ‘I would go to the match because I support the team,’ said Carver when asked if he would stay away as a supporter. ‘I think they (boycotters) do support the team but they have obviously got their own issues. I respect those issues. ‘I never thought I'd see this to be perfectly honest, especially in the North East of England because we love football. ‘So obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come, and I respect that.’ Carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against Tottenham Hotspur .

This is the moment when a not-so-little baby elephant seal emerged from the sea to give a surprised tourist one big cuddle. Charlene Fritz, 35, was visiting  Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula as part of an expedition when she made an unusual friend on the beach. Despite being no more than two months old, the elephant seal pup is still thought to have weighed around 200lbs, and Ms Fritz had a struggle sitting upright. Scroll down for video . One big cuddle: The elephant seal is thought to have been no more than two months old, but at a whopping 200lbs, Canadian tourist Charlene Fritz still struggled to reciprocate the hug . Making friends: Ms Fritz had the surprise of a lifetime when the baby elephant seal came out of the water for a cuddle during an expedition to Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula . Will you be my mummy? Elephant seal pups are abandoned by their mothers at just one month to learn how to take care of themselves . Charlene, from Saskatchewan, Canada, said: 'The seal climbed on top of me without hesitation. We shared a very sweet moment in time I will never forget. 'Her mouth was all pink inside and her eyes were amazing to look into. Like the deepest depths of the sea. I could have stared into her eyes forever.' She added: 'It was made very clear to me that I was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her. 'She came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up. I wanted to hug her so badly. 'Physically she felt like a big dough ball, super warm and like she had no bones. She did not smell of fish or have bad breath. She had never even eaten a fish at that point in her life. Rules: Ms Fritz explains that she badly wanted to hug the baby seal, but that regulations on the Antarctic expedition dictated that she in no way touch the pup . 'Sweet moment in time': Ms Fritz described the seal pup's eyes as being 'like the deepest depths of the sea' Crushing: Ms Fritz struggles to sit upright under the weight of the 200lbs baby elephant seal . Two young elephant selas have a rest on the shore of Snow Hill Island, Antarctic Peninsula . Charlene, whose 2011 encounter with the seal was filmed by a friend, had at first wondered why the seal was so friendly but later learned about the harsh weaning process. She said: 'Basically the mother fattens them up with her milk for a month or so, then abandons them on the beach. 'They have never been in the ocean to learn to fish or anything and basically lay there starving until they figure out to take the leap of faith and go into the sea. 'This is why they can be so sweet and looking for love, I guess.' However, an encounter with a full-grown elephant would have been a different prospect. Males of the species can weigh up to two tonnes and are known to have a nasty temper during mating season as the battle to control harems of females.

(CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are "conscientious objectors," and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new "no jab, no pay" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. "The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments," said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. "It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing," Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.

Many people might think that trust issues, long distances and cheating scandals are the biggest strains on a relationship. But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.

James Bond would have lasted just seven minutes into his last movie Skyfall before succumbing to fatal wounds from a uranium shot if the secret agent played by Daniel Craig was real. A group of medical experts watched the 23rd outing for Ian Fleming's hero and concluded that Bond would have been unlikely to survive to the end of the two hour film, and would have died or been critically injured several times . Within the first seven minutes, Bond is hit by a depleted uranium shell - an armour-piercing round normally used to destroy tanks that would almost certainly have killed the hero. Scroll down for video . James Bond would have died minutes into Skyfall - after being hit by a depleted uranium shell and then falling from a speeding train, where he could easily have severed his spine . As Bond fights in an icy loch he would have been likely to have died from the cold or lack of oxygen . In a feature for Total Film, the medical experts examine several different action movies to see whether the man characters would have survived their ordeal. Other movies to undergo the medical assessment were Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis. Unsurprisingly John McClane would not have survived. According to the experts, Bond's depleted uranium wound would have been fatal as it 'would have turned his lungs inside out and killed him'. In the unlikely event the massive round did not cause catastrophic injuries, the radioactive nature of the ammunition 'would greatly increase his cancer risk'. Bond cheats death throughout the two hour film, including when he is locked in a gunfight on the streets of Istanbul as he attempts to chase villain Patrice for a hard drive containing details of undercover agents . The hero effortlessly performs surgery on himself, but would have been likely to have lost too much blood . Not that growing old gracefully was ever likely for James Bond, who at one stage performs surgery on himself to remove a bullet, where he 'risks blood loss, lack of consciousness, nerve and muscle damage'. He also faces a significant risk of infection. Even jumping from the roof of a speeding train into a river presents its own risks, which probably should not be tried by ordinary members of the public as he would likely 'sever his spinal cord or break his neck'. 7 mins - Bond is shot in the chest by a depleted uranium bullet, likely to kill. If he had survived this the radioactive qualities of the ammunition would have increased his risk of cancer. 12 mins - The action hero is shot and then jumps from the roof of a speeding train into a river. The height of this fall would be likely to break his neck. 31 mins - After being shot Bond bravely removes a bullet from his shoulder. This DIY surgery would have led to significant blood loss as well as damaged his nerves and muscles. 2hrs - Bond fights in an icy loch. While the temperature alone would have presented problems, fighting underwater would have significantly depleted Bond's oxygen supply and could have caused him to drown. While James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 has survived since 1960, it is unlikely the man himself would have . However, filming the movie can prove slightly dangerous as Daniel Craig has recently required knee surgery after hurting himself while performing a stunt in his final Bond movie Spectre. Even Home Alone would have produced three fatalities. Marv and Harry would have likely died within hours of the movie's end while Kevin would have been killed within the first third of the film after falling from some shelves. However, Tom Hanks in Cast Away could have plausibly survived on a desert island for four years - as long as he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash. Although according to the experts, 76 per cent of the time he would have died in the accident. While Bruce WIllis' character in Die Hard, John McClane, pictured, would not have made it to the fourth movie . Tom Hanks in Castaway could have survived on the island - in the unlikely event he escaped the aircraft .

Need to have a difficult conversation with your other half or your boss? It might be a good idea to take them out to dinner. We get on better with each other over a meal, according to researchers who said it makes everyone from work colleagues to children seem more pleasant. Dutch and Canadian scientists asked nearly 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent at least five minutes talking to someone else. Well digested: Scientists have found people felt happier and more relaxed while eating at home or at work . About a fifth of the 1,000 meetings recorded took place over a meal, the journal Physiology and Behavior reports. On these occasions participants felt happier and more relaxed, whether at home, at work or elsewhere. They felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments and were more likely to make compromises. They also believed that the person they were with was warmer and more likeable. And hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. One possible explanation is that chewing raises levels of the ‘feel-good’ brain chemical serotonin. Food for thought: The study found that people can talk about tricky subjects far easier over a meal . It is also possible that shared meals enhance our inbuilt desire to be accepted and to please others. Marije aan het Rot, of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, said that tricky topics might be best tackled over a meal. Bosses and employees and also parents and children, might all find it easier to get on at the table while dinner may not be the best idea for a first date. Dr Rot said the people in her study knew each other and the effect of a sharing a meal might be different among strangers. Apart from anything else, meals can be lengthy and people meeting for the first time might struggle to come up with enough conversation.

Have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door, been woken by a Facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger? To deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies, one company has designed a range of prototype products. You can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product, funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Scroll down for video . Leeds-based Direct Line is running a competition called #EverydayFix. They asked groups to design products to deal with common problems. These include forgetting to lock the door, which one company hopes to solve with their Forget Me Lock prototype, shown . The products were designed as part of the Direct Line Everyday Fix design makeathon. They asked people to pick their top ten ‘everyday emergencies’ - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives. Groups from London-based design company Makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist. 1. Not being able to sleep (46 per cent*) 2. Losing your keys (37 per cent) 3. Being stuck in traffic when already late (35 per cent) 4. Losing an important paper or document (33 per cent) 5. Nowhere to park (32 per cent) 6. Printer not working when you need to print something (31 per cent) 7. Running out of battery on your phone whilst out (31 per cent) 8. Discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo (30 per cent) 9. Dealing with machine operated customer service (26 per cent) 10. Forgetting your bank card when paying for an item (25 per cent) *How many people thought this was a problem . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called ‘Snooze’, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep. To deal with not remembering if you had locked your door, ONN Studio created the Forget Me Lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door. It fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. This means that even when out or about, you can find out if your door is locked or not. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost. Direct Line is running a competition on Twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about Snooze, Forget Me Lock or Nipper. The Forget Me Lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key. When the key is turned in a lock it swivels green  to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost . The Nipper device (shown) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called Snooze, shown, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep . Whichever tweet has the most retweets, with the #EverydayFix hashtag, by 23 April will go into a Kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development. ‘We’ve seen the great British designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies,’ said Paul Smyth, co-founder of Makerversity. ‘Through the Direct Line Everyday Fix event, we’ve been able to extend our role as "fixers" and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation’s everyday emergencies,’ added John Shaw, head of R&D and Innovation at Direct Line. Of the products that didn’t make the cut, one was a helmet with ‘bone conduction headphones’ that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you. Another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space, which would then alert you when the space was free, if you couldn’t find somewhere to park. And as another solution to your phone running out of battery, one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies. Products that didn't make the final shortlist included the Parking Pin, shown. You could leave this in a parking space, and it will alert you when the space is free, so you can park your car . The Relay app, shown, would let you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies . And the 'Hat Nav' was a smart helmet that used ‘bone conduction headphones’ to give you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .

A cancer survivor who had to have part of his mouth removed after a tumour stopped him from swallowing has been given a new tongue made out of part of his arm. David Billing, 48, has told how he had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital, during which surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue. Medics then replaced the lost tissue with muscle from Mr Billing's arm. The only drawback is that it still has hairs on it, and he now has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved. David Billing, 48, had to have part of his tongue removed after being diagnosed with mouth cancer, so doctors made him a new one out of skin from his arm - which still has hairs on it . The dramatic story began after Mr Billing, a part-time welder, went to his GP in October 2013 after being unable to swallow. After a second doctor's appointment, he was referred to Royal Derby where specialists discovered an ulcer on the right-hand side of his tongue and confirmed it was cancer after a biopsy. He said: 'Being told I had cancer was mind-blowing and a real low point for me. I had no idea when they found this ulcer in my mouth that this was what it would be.' It was a double-blow for Mr Billing, as he had been made redundant just a week before from his job at digger manufacturer JCB. He said: 'It was all so overwhelming. My life and everything was ticking along nicely and the next thing I knew I'd lost my job and needed to have a major operation.' David had the procedure to remove the lump and rebuild his tongue on November 13, 2013. He said: 'I had to have a stomach tube fitted first and then go through the main procedure. Mr Billing was forced to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital (pictured), with surgeons sawing between two teeth and through his jaw to get to the tumour . 'They had to cut through the jawbone and get my face wide open to get to the ulcer then they had to remove some lymph nodes in my neck too, just to be safe in case the cancer had spread.' David spent nine days in hospital after his operation, returning now only for check-ups and once for the smaller procedure to reshape his tongue. He said: 'Usually, people have to go on chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the operation and, during this, the skin tissue used to rebuild the tongue shrinks in size. 'Because I didn't need either, it meant I later needed this smaller operation to have the bit of skin trimmed. 'My tongue's absolutely fine. I had to have speech therapy after the procedure but it's not had any long term impact on my speech or my eating or drinking.' David continued to use a feeding tube and relied on liquid foods until his first proper meal on Christmas Day 2013. And, in another fortunate turn of events, he was offered his old job a JCB back in March 2014. He added: 'JCB actually took me back having originally laid me off because of a lack of work. Mr Billing, who is now preparing to run the London Marathon to raise money for Cancer Research, says his speech is back to normal - though he does have to go to hospital to have his tongue shaved . 'It was the best feeling in the world when, two weeks after coming through the operation, the consultant told me the cancer was completely removed and I didn't even need radiotherapy or chemotherapy.' Now David is preparing to run the London Marathon and is hoping to raise more than £3,000 for cancer research. He said: 'I was not fit or well at all when I was watching the London Marathon last year but I thought how much I'd love to do it. 'I've never done anything like it before so, when I started feeling better, I decided to start training and now I'm about to take part in this experience of a lifetime. 'If I can get over the finish line, whatever time I do it in, it will be absolutely brilliant.'

The lovers who got the most complaints in New York City for loud sex are a handyman and the girlfriend he pops round for quickies with in the building where he works. The 25-year-old boytoy is the lover, of a Dominican woman in her late 30s, who invites him round for romps around her entire apartment in Brooklyn. The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex. Most complained: The building maintenance worker (left) and his girlfriend (right), who is now four months pregnant, were complained about six times for excessive noise at the Bay Ridge block, official records show . Say it loud: This is the apartment block with six calls made to 311 - New York city's non-emergency number - because of complaints of loud sex . Blue: The woman who was complained about was spoken to by police today. She later left, saying: 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone.' The woman whose moans during sex sparked the highest number of complaints in New York said today: 'I'm not hurting anyone'. The woman, who declined to give her name, walked out of the apartment block wearing striped maxi dres, a white jacket and sunglasses. She looked upset and said she was hurt by all the attention - and revealed she was pregnant. She said: 'I'm four months pregnant. 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'. On the job: The building handyman complained about over noisy sex was at work today - at the apartment block where his girlfriend lives. House of noise: The apartment building is in Bay Ridge, close to New York harbor in Brooklyn . No idea: The building's owner Madelene Behefte told Daily Mail Online she had no idea about the complaints . No respite: The front door of the apartment at the center of six complaints for noisy sex. It failed to stop neighbors from overhearing the couple's antics . DNAInfo reported that New York's 311 helpline, for non-emergency complaints to city authorities, recorded a total of 133 complaints about loud sex between January 1 2014 and February 12 2015. Brooklyn, the borough now associated with trendy hipsters and home to would-be president Hillary Clinton's campaign, had the highest number of complaints, at 42. Brooklyn is the most populous of the city's five boroughs. Queens was next with 37, the Bronx and 31 and Manhattan had 23. Staten Island recorded none. The website reported that on November 14 last year, a 311 operator logged: 'Neighbors are having very loud sex with the windows open that can be heard throughout the whole bldg.' The complainant told the website the woman was 'moaning and screaming "Oh yeah, oh, do it to me".' It was followed by another woman shouting at the couple: 'Shut your f***ing windows you wh**e.' Complaints to 311 are passed to police to investigate if they are available, but officers found no noise disturbance when they attended the Bay Ridge block.

Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless. The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, José Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than £300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for. Pacquiao works up a sweat as he shadow boxes during preparations for his May 2 clash with Mayweather . With his eyes closed and grimacing with effort, Pacquiao ramps up his shadow boxing routine on Monday . On his toes and focused, Pacquiao is looking to defy the odds against fight favourite Floyd Mayweather . Roach kneels in the corner as Pacquiao's team prepare the eight-division champion for a session on the pads . The Filipino works his way around the ring, looking sharp after sharing a joke with Shapiro and Roach . Pacman limbers up ahead of his workout on Monday in the gym just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood . Pacquiao is going through his final preparations ahead of the bout billed as 'The Biggest Fight in History' Confident Pacquiao kicks his feet high during his warm-up ahead of training at Wild Card Boxing . There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight. Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout. 'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'

Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to quit because he was becoming increasing depressed watching cable news . Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to call time on his 17 year reign because he was becoming increasing depressed by American politics and watching cable news. Speaking for the first time since making his shock decision, Stewart said he was looking forward to not having to watch the 'relentless' 24-hour news networks anymore. 'Watching these channels all day is incredibly depressing,' Stewart told The Guardian. 'I live in a constant state of depression. I think of us as turd miners. I put on my helmet, I go and mine turds, hopefully I don't get turd lung disease.' Asked if he'd ever voluntarily watch Fox News, Stewart said, 'Let's say that it's a nuclear winter, and I have been wandering, and there appears to be a flickering light through what appears to be a radioactive cloud and I think that light might be a food source that could help my family. 'I might glance at it for a moment until I realize, that's Fox News, and then I shut it off.' Stewart also confessed that his 'moments of dissatisfaction' with the show had started to become more frequent. 'It's not like I thought [The Daily Show] wasn't working any more, or that I didn't know how to do it. It was more, "Yup, it's working. But I'm not getting the same satisfaction,'" he said. 'These things are cyclical. You have moments of dissatisfaction, and then you come out of it and it's OK. But the cycles become longer and maybe more entrenched, and that's when you realize, "OK, I'm on the back side of it now.'" Scroll down for video . Stewart said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance in 2011 . Even the upcoming 2016 Presidential election campaign couldn't reignite Stewart's passion the way it once did. 'I'd covered an election four times, and it didn't appear that there was going to be anything wildly different about this one,' said Stewart. 'Honestly, it was a combination of the limitations of my brain and a format that is geared towards following an increasingly redundant process, which is our political process. 'I was just thinking, "Are there other ways to skin this cat?' And, beyond that, it would be nice to be home when my little elves get home from school, occasionally." Stewart also said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance. The former secretary of defense appeared on The Daily Show in 2011 for an interview, which the comedian says he messed up. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, left, would be taking over . 'He just went into the general gobbledegook,' said Stewart. "Mnah mnah mnah, well, you have to remember, it was 9/11 mnah mnah." I should have pushed, but he's very adept at deflecting.' Rumsfeld, who was on the show to promote his memoir, Known And Unknown, dodged Stewart's questions about faulty U.S. intelligence leading up to the Iraq War. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, 31, would be taking over. Noah has already had to combat  accusations of anti-Semitism over a series of old tweets. Stewart has voiced his full support for his successor, recently calling the incoming host 'incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart.' The exiting host told The Guardian that one reason for  stepping down early in the presidential election cycle was to give Noah a big story to tackle. Stewart said he felt 'that, for the show, you don't want to leave when the cupboard's bare. So I think it's a better introduction when you have something providing you with assisted fuel, like a presidential campaign.'

An eight-grade girl accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in adult jail while awaiting trial, a judge. A defense petition to return 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek to the juvenile facility where she was initially sent after the body of 54-year-old Cheryl Silvonek was discovered last month was denied by Lehigh County Judge Maria Dantos on Friday. District Attorney Jim Martin had opposed the petition on behalf of the teenager, who is charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy. Her boyfriend, Caleb Barnes, 20, who is from El Paso, Texas, but was stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, is charged with homicide. JamieSilvonek, the eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, it was ruled on Friday . Cheryl Silvonek's body was found with stab wounds in a shallow grave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and her vehicle partially submerged in a pond a few miles from the family home. Jamie Silvonek was sent to the county jail this month after she was charged as an adult and is in the women's housing unit, away from older inmates, county officials said. Authorities said Barnes and the teenager met in October, when she was 13, but she told him she was 17. Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. The teen's mother found out about their relationship in early March and ordered them to end it. A day later, the teen told Barnes in a text message, 'I want her gone,' police said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. The 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. 14-year-old JamieSilvonek allegedly conspired to kill her mother Cheryl Silvonek with her 20-year-old boyfriend 'because she disapproved of their relationship' Barnes confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, and that given the age disparity 'there has to be some type of duress or coercion'. He said his client 'cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom' and she feared for her life and that of her father. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life . Police found the body of Cheryl Silvonek in a shallow grave a few miles from her home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby .

Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed for a year after orchestrating a scam to steal £15,000 of goods from the Asda in Basildon, Essex, where he worked . An Asda manager orchestrated a scam that used the supermarket's own delivery service to steal goods worth more than £15,000 - then managed to land a job at Lidl after he was sacked. Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed after running the scam where stock including alcohol, cigarettes, DVDs, computer games and consoles were taken from the store in Basildon, Essex, where he worked. Southend Crown Court heard how the conspiracy was uncovered, following a period during which Gridley and colleague Jay Reed were under suspicion. Thomas Daniel, prosecuting, told the court that goods, ranging from televisions to baby formula, were delivered to Reed's address and presumably sold on. He said: 'Two anonymous reports were received by Asda, one of which suggested Mr Gridley was involved in selling items believed to have been stolen, such as TVs and baby formula. 'When Mr Gridley was ill for a certain period of time, those deliveries stopped, and when he recovered they started again. 'Another email suggested stolen goods being delivered to the address of Mr Gridley's cousin.' But shockingly, after being sacked from the store, Gridley managed to land a managerial role at Lidl in Romford, Essex. Gridley, who was former home shopping manager of the store, was sentenced to 12 months for his leading role in a conspiracy to steal £15,852.46 worth of goods between November 2013 and April last year. The court heard that Reed and another defendant James Munyard had been pressured into taking part in the scam by Gridley, who was their superior. Stock including alcohol, cigarettes were taken from shelves and delivered to addresses using the supermarket's own home delivery service. File photo . Section leader Reed, 23, and Munyard, 21, both avoided prison, but were given suspended sentences of eight and four months, respectively. Mitchell Cohen, representing Munyard, told the court that his client, whose role was confined to taking items off shelves and putting them in a crate, had attempted to be transferred from the store in order to escape Gridley's control. James Munyard (pictured) avoided jail for his part in the scam . Reed was deemed to have been in a position of trust and responsibility in the criminal enterprise, but Recorder Gerard Pounder said he had a lesser role than Gridley, 26, and Munyard even less so. Despite hearing Gridley, of Tilbury,  financially supported his former partner and their two-year-old child but also his own father and grandparents, Recorder Pounder said he had no choice but to send him to prison. He said: 'You were in a position of supreme trust and you say you started this because of threats made regarding a drug debt of your cousin's, you continued even as those threats faded, and brought other people in, too.' Sentencing Reed to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 200 hours' unpaid work, he said: 'You were in a lesser role than Mr Gridley but you were a section leader and had responsibilities. 'In that respect you were somebody who knew the system and it was to your premises these items were taken - without that and your part in the enterprise, it would not have worked.' Munyard, who Mr Cohen said 'didn't have the spine to stand up to what he was being asked to do,' was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, and 100 hours' unpaid work. A spokesperson for Lidl told MailOnline they are unable to comment until an internal investigation has been conducted.

The 14-time major champion is bidding to win his fifth green jacket, but has been plagued by a succession of injuries and even the chipping yips in recent times. The world will find out which version of Woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48pm. Defending champion Bubba Watson, hoping to win his third Masters title in four years, will tee off at 2.24pm alongside England's former US Open champion Justin Rose and 21-year-old South Korean amateur Gunn Yang, who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the US Amateur last year. Those watching the 2.02pm group on Thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game's most colourful characters go head-to-head. Ian Poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet, but even he might meet his match in American young gun Patrick Reed, who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at Doral last year. He followed that up by shushing the home crowd during a cocksure display at Gleneagles. Three-time Masters champion Phil MIckelson, hitting from behind trees during practice, will play alongside McIlroy in the first two rounds . Ryan Moore, pictured during a practice round at Augusta, will join McIlroy and Mickelson on the course for round one and two . Woods will be accompanied with Wales' Jamie Donaldson and Jimmy Walker of the USA during the first two rounds of the competition . US Open champion Martin Kaymer is in the group behind world No 1 McIlroy, with Brandt Snedeker and Houston Open winner JB Holmes. McIlroy and Mickelson were among the players battling for the US PGA title in near-darkness at Valhalla last year, with Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light. With 98 players in the field, Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45pm (7:45am local time), with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier, the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while Arnold Palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder. England's Danny Willett will begin his Masters debut in the second group at 12:56pm alongside 1987 winner Larry Mize and US amateur public links champion Byron Meth. Woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth Masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round. The American superstar has started just two events in 2015, carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second, but said he was ready to 'compete to win a golf tournament' after 11 holes of practice on Monday. The final group tees off at 1:59pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world, Australia's Jason Day, Spain's Sergio Garcia and Fowler. Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors last year.

A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by £345 to £975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from £870 to £1,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices . The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from £870 to £1,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game . Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay £345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost £975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season . Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.

A pregnant mother with a rare form of dwarfism has revealed the physical challenges of raising her three-year-old son - who is more than half her size - while preparing for the arrival of her second child. Tiffanie DiDonato, from Swansboro, North Carolina, was born with diastrophic dysplasia and underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries as a child so she would grow to be 4'10 tall, instead of her previous height of 3'8, which is how tall her son Titan currently is. But even with the additional inches, parenting a rambunctious toddler can be difficult for the 34-year-old mom who has certain physical limitations, and often has to use crutches, or sometimes a wheelchair, in addition to being three months pregnant. 'Titan is a typical kid – he wants to do what he wants to do,' she told People of her son. 'And chasing him outside or across the street is not an option for me.' Helping hand: Tiffanie DiDonato, who has diastrophic dysplasia, a rare form of dwarfism, can be seen grocery shopping with her three-year-old son Titan, who is more than half her size, but always willing to assist her . Making it work: The 34-year-old mom from Swansboro, North Carolina, is 4'10 tall and is constantly re-teaching herself to walk because of the stiff muscles and arthritis, which are side effects of her dwarfism . Tiffanie, who married to Eric Gabrielse, a 6’1, 29-year-old Marine who is 6'0, explained that she has to get creative when it comes to dealing with her son - especially when he throws himself on the floor and cries. When tantrums occurs she will walk way and say: 'Mommy can't help when you're yelling at me... No crying and Mommy can help.' Tiffanie noted that this trick, which she has developed over time, usually prompts her son to get up and give her a hug. 'I try my best to let him know throwing tantrums doesn't get you very far - a great lesson to learn, don't you think?' she said. Great news: Tiffanie and her husband Eric Gabrielse, a 29-year-old Marine, are expecting their second child in September . All smiles: Titan happily cuddled up to his dad for this snapshot . Full of life: The three-year-old had a laugh while his dad Eric enjoyed his breakfast . Tiffanie, who co-wrote the memoir Dwarf with Rennie Dyball, has difficulty lifting Titan now that is getting taller because her arms are significantly shorter than most moms. The stiff muscles and arthritis that are side effects of her condition mean that she has to constantly re-teach herself how to walk - which makes chasing after Titan impossible. Losing control of her son is one of her greatest fears, which is why she avoids leaving the house with Titan when she doesn’t her husband Eric or another family member by her side. 'I have even watched Eric struggle to catch him outside and he's a Marine!' she explained. ‘We named Titan correctly, because he's almost too speedy and too athletic.' Because she 'wouldn't stand a chance' against outracing her son, she makes sure she stays '10 steps ahead of the game' at all times. Overcoming obstacles: Tiffanie can be seen as a child wearing braces on her legs. She underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries when she was younger . Painful choice: Tiffanie was expected to be 3'8 tall, but her surgeries allowed her to grow to 4'10, enabling her to be more independent . Tiffanie recalled times in which Titan has climbed into the dryer or wedged himself behind the couch or plopped himself inside the sink. Without physically being able to get him out on her own, she has to rely on her own quick thinking, as well as game she made up to ensure his cooperation. She explained that when she sings: 'One, two, three, help me!' and reaches out for Titan, he will take her hands and pull himself up and out of whatever precarious situation he has gotten himself into. Titan's willingness to lend his mom a helping hand is one of the reasons she is confident that he will be a fantastic big brother. 'He really is - whether he is intentionally doing so or no - becoming my little helper,' she said. 'We conquer the day-to-day challenges together, and I hope we always do.' Sweet moment: Tiffanie and Titan snuggled up together on the couch before he fell asleep . Support system: Tiffanie wore a yellow halter dress while posing for this photo with a friend . Sports fans: Eric and Tiffanie smiled for the camera at a Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium in New York City .

An Old Bailey judge has blasted his junior colleague for ‘taking his eye off the ball’ and passing an 'unlawful' sentence when letting a BT manager dodge jail for a £28,000 expenses scam. Wheelchair-bound  Christopher Starrs, 50, was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in January after admitting his part in a two-and-a-half year con against his employer BT. Starrs, along with fellow BT Openreach manager Phillip Tamplin, invented clamped cars, overtime hours and damage to home owners’ property during broadband installation, and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims. Blasted: Judge Nicholas Cooke QC (left) blasted his junior colleague Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC (right) for 'taking his eye off the ball' when he sentenced Christopher Starrs in January this year . Both Starrs and Tamplin, 53, who made £124,000 from the con, admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses. Tamplin was jailed for two years at January's sentencing hearing, but Mr Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC spared Starrs jail as an ‘act of mercy’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £1,500 fine. However, senior Judge Nicholas Cooke QC has now said the sentence was ‘unlawful’ - and added Starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes. ‘It was an unlawful sentence passed and now I need to do something to put it right, because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter,’ he said. ‘He was mercifully dealt with, sadly by a judge who didn’t have his eye on the ball.’ The judge told Mark Haslam, defending: ‘The sentence was wrong but that’s a matter of personal opinion. ‘Your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison. ‘What the Recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn’t available to him. ‘No one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on Mr Starrs was unlawful. ‘I am sorry to be the headmaster but we really don’t want this sort of thing.’ Fraud: Wheelchair-bound Starrs, 50, was a manager with BT who admitted defrauding the company of £28,000 over two years . The Recorder, who is the head of 4 Bream Buildings chambers and took the Silk in 2006, gave Starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine, and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue. But Judge Cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order. Turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing, he added: ‘This is supposed to be a centre of excellence, when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and can’t do. ‘The judge should have been told what his powers were.’ Prosecutor John Ojakovoh said Starrs offered a ‘blank cheque’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £28,000 he stole. After the judge heard the CPS will now drop the confiscation proceedings, he said the original sentence will stand, quipping: ‘He no doubt thanks his lucky stars.’ Both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time. The main fraudulent claim was for BT vehicles which had been ‘clamped’ by parking authorities. BT Openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work. The company pays out around £1million in fines in London alone every year. Starrs and Tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates. Sentencing Recorder Trimmer, who has led a string of high-profile Serious Fraud Office prosecutions in the last two years, said: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time. ‘It involved over 100 or so false claims, made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity. ‘Both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity. ‘You both knew how it could be conducted, concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally.’ Starrs, of Northolt, Middlesex, who had worked at BT since 1988, was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair. He was not at court today due to a mix-up over whether he was required to attend.

A forensic psychiatrist has testified that Lou Gehrig's disease is the reason a former sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his wife and sister-in-law, whom the defendant described in a suicide note as his threesome partners. Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.

The US body that regulates Internet addresses is looking to crack down on a Canadian company using the new '.sucks' domain name to extract exorbitant sums from celebrities such as Kevin Spacey and companies looking to protect their reputations. So far, purchased names include Youtube.sucks, Bing.sucks, Visa.sucks, Bankofamerica.sucks, Yahoo.sucks, Telusmobility.sucks and other major brand names. Kevin Spacey has reportedly paid have his his '.sucks' domain taken down. Kevin Spacey is reportedly among celebrities paying out to have their name removed from one of the  '.sucks' domains which opened on 30 March . Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains attacking her, CNBC reported. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or 'ICANN,'  sent a letter on Thursday to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Office of Consumer Affairs to see if the actions of company Vox Populi Registry Ltd. were illegal. ICANN initially approved of the so-called top-level domain name, among nearly 600 it has added recently to expand beyond common names such as '.com,' '.org' and '.us.' But it is backtracking after an advisory panel made up of industry groups and companies like Microsoft, Verizon and eBay complained last month. Vox Populi began accepting registrations using '.sucks' on March 30 from trademark holders and celebrities before it is released to public applicants. Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains . It has recommended charging $2,499 a year for the privilege, and according to Vox Populi CEO John Berard, most of the names have been sold by resellers for around $2,000 a year. Berard has said the domain name is meant to create destinations for companies to interact with their critics and called his company's business 'well within the lines of ICANN rules and the law.' Two weeks ago, the advisory body called the Intellectual Property Constituency representing major companies and industry groups asked ICANN in a letter to halt the rollout of '.sucks,' calling it a 'shakedown scheme' and 'predatory.' Companies like GoDaddy.com register some domain names for just $1 a year, and Vox Populi will offer consumers the right to secure a '.sucks' address for just $10 a year starting in September. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme.' ICANN said in its letter that if Canadian or U.S. regulators find Vox Populi's actions are illegal, it could declare the company in breach of its contract and seek to change the registry's behavior. It said it is also seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme .

The semi-final line-up for the Champions League has been confirmed and, although there may be no English involvement, four European giants are just three games from being crowned champions of the continent in Berlin on June 6. With Real Madrid and Juventus winning on Wednesday to join Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the last four, this season's competition is one of the toughest to call in recent memory. We asked our team of reporters who they think will win this season's Champions League. SAMI MOKBEL - Barcelona . Momentum is key at this point in the season and Barcelona are in overdrive. Their early-season woes are a distant memory and Luis Enrique is finally getting his point across. Lionel Messi remains phenomenal and a certain Luis Suarez is hitting top gear just at the right time. Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left) , Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) NEIL ASHTON - Bayern Munich . They overcame their blip (the rip in the seam of Pep's trousers) to power their way beyond Porto in the second leg of the quarter-final and remind everyone just how good they are. They have much to prove after last season's disappointment but they are a phenomenal team. I expect them to draw Barcelona in the semi-final. Bayern Munich produced a stunning display in the second leg to beat Porto in the quarter-finals . JOE BERNSTEIN - Barcelona . Bayern and Barcelona are both better teams than Juventus or Real Madrid and to separate them is nigh on impossible. But given the backroom strife at Bayern, particularly over Arjen Robben's injury, I'd narrowly go for Messi and Barcelona ending their four-year Champions League 'drought'. DOMINIC KING - Barcelona . To think at the start of the season, after Real Madrid pummelled them in the first Clasico, that we thought the beginning of the end had started. Now they look majestic once more and the front three of Messi, Neymar and Suarez gives them an edge over all their rivals. Hopefully it will be a straight shootout between them and Bayern Munich in Berlin. This is the best Champions League semi-final line-up ever and we might get the spectacular final to go with it. LEE CLAYTON - Juventus . Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba and Gianluigi Buffon -  experience, goals and know-how. Tevez isn't Messi (or Cristiano Ronaldo), Pogba isn't Thomas Muller and Buffon isn't Manuel Neuer: Yes, they are ugly bugs on a catwalk of super powers, but they CAN win this. After all, Denmark and Greece both won the Euros. Juventus celebrate their 1-0 aggregate victory over Monaco in the last eight of the Champions League . Juventus striker Carlos Tevez leads the scoring in Serie A this season with 18 goals . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI - Barcelona . Since it's been established that we don't live in a post-Messi (48 goals in 49 starts) world I can't bring myself to bet against him. Would love to see them in a final against Bayern Munich. CHRIS WHEELER - Bayern Munich . After that crushing 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the semi-finals a year ago, and the shock of suffering a 3-1 first-leg loss to Porto in this season’s quarters, expect the real Bayern to stand up and deliver another Champions League triumph for Guardiola. Is it written in the stars that Barcelona will be standing in his way? LAURIE WHITWELL - Barcelona . The front three of Messi, Suarez, and Neymar are beginning to click to devastating effect and the magical allure of Barcelona is returning. It would be some turnaround from the disputes and disappointments of early season, but this is a team full of players who know how to win the trophy. Neymar scored both goals in Barcelona's 2-0 second-leg victory over Paris Saint-Germain at the Nou Camp . LAURA WILLIAMSON - Real Madrid . They might be depleted by injuries but experience and pedigree count in this competition and, as we saw against Atletico Madrid, you can never count against the 10-time winners. Or, indeed, a certain Ronaldo. Javier Hernandez's 88th-minute winner saw Real Madrid edge past their local rivals Atletico Madrid . Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League title and a second in a row with Real Madrid . ROB DRAPER - Bayern Munich . Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben are on the way back, Pep  has a point to prove and the team have the memory of that awful semi-final against Real Madrid last year to drive them on. As long as they don't take their foot off the gas having already won the Bundesliga, they'll make good the disappointment of last year. Robert Lewandowski celebrates one of five first-half goals Bayern Munich scored against Porto on Tuesday . JACK GAUGHAN - Barcelona . I'm tempted to say Bayern Munich but they've got similar buckling deficiencies to the Barcelona we've seen recently. By contrast, the Catalans have found their misplaced defensive steel, have a coach whose win percentage eclipses all to precede him and - well - possess Messi. And Neymar. And Suarez. SAM CUNNINGHAM - Bayern Munich . I would back Guardiola to outwit any of the remaining managers in the tournament with the players at his disposal. Some were writing Bayern Munich off after their 3-1 first-leg defeat by Porto and look how that went. Everyone talks about Messi and Ronaldo, but the collective force of Bayern players is frightening. OLIVER TODD - Barcelona . After a difficult start to the season they've hit form at the right time. Enrique has found a way to get the front three of Messi,  Suarez and Neymar to fire and even if you can keep two of them quiet - as Paris Saint-Germain did on Tuesday - the other will make you pay.

Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.

Steve Davis would love to see Jimmy White and Reanne Evans light up the Crucible stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn. The king of the baize in the 1980s believes the Whirlwind and the doyenne of the women's tour face tall orders to get through qualifying for the Betfred World Championship. Evans saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion Ken Doherty on Thursday, in the first of three preliminary rounds, while White will tackle fellow veteran James Wattana in his opener on Saturday. Steve Davis will attempt to qualify for this year's Betfred World Championship at the Crucible . But Davis, who will also attempt to qualify, expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in Sheffield. He calls 29-year-old Dudley potter Evans 'a great player', and said of the 10-time ladies' world champion: 'It's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods. It's a bun fight, but she's perhaps the best woman player I've ever seen. 'In the 1980s I saw Allison Fisher who was the best around, and she was an excellent, excellent player but more methodical. 'Reanne is more like the Jimmy White or the Ronnie O'Sullivan of the women's game. She has the feel for the game, she's at one with the table. 'She could cause a surprise, but to win three matches is the tough bit. It's hard enough for me and Jimmy. 'If me or Jimmy qualify for the Crucible, it's arguably as big a win as we've ever had. 'I've got a little bit of a desire to do it, but Jimmy would certainly love to get back to the Crucible.' Reanne Evans takes on Ken Docherty for a place at the World Championships in Sheffield . Reanne Evans is a 10-time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010-11 season. She suffered 18 consecutive defeats however and failed to qualify the following year. White, who lost six World Championship finals, last appeared at the tournament in 2006, and has fallen short in qualifying every year since. While 52-year-old White is in the autumn of his career, for Davis these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down. He turns 58 in August and fell off the main tour 12 months ago. A memoir, Interesting, hits the bookshelves on Thursday. A tricky qualifying opener against Jamie Cope could end in disappointment, but it would be short-lived. 'I can't build up the intensity that I used to have, but I must admit I'm getting excited about pitting my wits against another generation of players,' Davis said. 'Of course, it'll all end in tears. 'I'm not totally committed but I still have the juices running through me a little bit. I've been practising but it's not a pretty sight. They're wobbling more in the pockets before saying 'nope'. 'Whether I get to the TV stages, that's a long shot. That's tough. Jimmy White will take on fellow veteran James Wattana in qualifying on Thursday . 'I was still practising hard even when I wasn't getting to the latter stages of the Crucible, and in the end you have to say, 'Yeah, I've tried, but the price is too much investment of time'. 'Now if I've lost a match, by the time I've got in the car I've thought about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day, rather than beating up the person who's come up with me. 'I think it's been a bit like Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I'm sure in the night that someone swapped me for a more mellow version.' Davis won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament, but the 1985 'black-ball final' defeat to Dennis Taylor stands over and above all memories. Dennis Taylor in action during the memorable 1985 World Championship final against Davis . The second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant Davis having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again. 'I don't remember anything as much as I remember the '85 final,' Davis said. 'I do remember the last frame, more so because I've watched it through on video a few times. 'My career was a blur and all games and matches blur into one in the end, it's only the strange moments that do stick in your brain.'

(CNN)Is America a nation divided?  And has Ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions? It's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation: immigration, community and police relations, poverty, education and dozens of other crucial matters facing America. Adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite, and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country. In Ohio, we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services, criminal justice, economic competiveness, infrastructure -- and I've enjoyed sharing our state's winning formula with others in my travels. In 2011, I returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in Congress in the 1980s and '90s.  Over the intervening years, Ohio had lost its way and was hurting. I felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 Ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet. Ohio is much stronger today. And that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing. For example, we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation's strongest state budgets and a nearly $2 billion surplus. We've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones. We've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in America, including tax cuts for the working poor. We're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and Ohio's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade. Getting Ohio back on track wasn't easy. It required big ideas, going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests. Yes, we have a great success story to tell about our state. And we need to make Ohio's success contagious. The leadership style that helped us turn around Ohio is needed in Washington, where America's $18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting Mother's Day if it required their action. Great leaders are not primarily guided by polls, political parties, focus groups, re-election, special interests or protecting the status quo. Instead they bring teams of people together, challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee in Congress in the 1990s, I helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. We worked in a bipartisan effort that doesn't happen enough. There were, of course, disagreements along the way, but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means. Given the polarizing issues facing our country, America needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego, selfishness and power produce. Leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets, tax cuts, welfare reform, border security, immigration and health care. We see it every day. There are certain values that guide great countries: . • Personal responsibility: It obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities. • Empathy: It allows us to walk in someone else's shoes, so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another, better way that makes all of us stronger. • Teamwork: It sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win. • Faith: It tells us we are made special in the image of God with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth. These values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all Americans instead of producing rhetoric, sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform. In Ohio we've implemented this winning strategy. It's worked there, and it will work for the nation as well.

A tortoise has been reunited with his owner after spending nearly a year on the run and even finding a new home - at the age of 109. Owner Wendy Stokes, 74, had given up hope of ever seeing Toby again after he escaped from her garden 11 months ago. But he has now returned home and after piecing together his escapades over the last year, it's become apparent he's had quite an adventure. Reunited: Wendy Stokes, 74, is delighted to have 109-year-old Toby back after his escape 11 months ago . He wandered through a gate in her garden and headed for the open road where he was picked up by a passing driver concerned for his safety and taken to a nearby animal rescue centre. Six months ago, he was re-homed with a couple living in Margate, Kent, 22 miles away from Wendy's farm in West Hougham. But the couple, who could just about make out the word 'Stokes' written in white paint on his shell, felt they needed to find out who Tony belonged to. With nothing else to go on, they decided to call every Stokes in Kent listed in the phonebook. Eventually came across a delighted Wendy, who immediately arranged to collect him. She's had Toby since the 1980s when he was given to her by her late great aunt. He was returned home last Sunday, a full 11 months after his amazing, if a little slow, adventure. Wendy has had Toby since the 1980s and wrote her surname, Stokes, on his back in white paint . Retired farm worker Wendy said: 'I had painted my name and number on the side of his shell but it had faded when he went missing so they couldn't read it. 'The people who found him could read Stokes but they couldn't make out the number. 'He had got out because I had left my gate open. It is normally closed because we have sheep in the paddock but they were in a different field. 'Toby just walked out and trotted towards the road where somebody picked him up and took him to a rescue centre. 'Everyone knows I have a tortoise and we always take him to the village fete so he is a bit of a local celebrity. 'I was devastated when he went missing and spent weeks looking for him in all the fields around the farm.' She added: 'I went all goosey when they told me they had Toby because I had really given up on him. 'It is brilliant having him back and I think everybody was keeping their eye out for him all this time.'

A vicious swan known for terrorising punters and kayakers on the River Cam is now believed to have a grandson following in his footsteps. The savage swan nicknamed Asbaby, which still has many brown baby feathers, has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the Cambridge river. Mr Asbo, the swan believed to be his grandfather, was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 by river authorities after repeatedly attacking rowers. Scroll down for video . Watch out: Savage swan Asbaby has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the river in Cambridge over the Easter weekend . Up close: One resident who lives near the river said Asbaby 'sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers' Theft: Asbaby was seen attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag (above) Capturing the moment: Asbaby (pictured) is believed to be the grandson of Mr Asbo, who was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 . Pecking at the punters: The swan on the River Cam is said to be even more vicious than his father, Asboy, and grandfather, Asbo . Asbaby was seen at the weekend attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag. He is said to have inherited his bad temper from his grandfather, and his father Asboy, who conducted a reign of terror on the river last summer. Harry Crossell, 65, who lives near the river, said: ‘He is even more vicious than his father and grandfather. '(He) sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers. I’ve seen him chasing after punts and taking their picnics. 'Once I even saw him put his beak around a bottle of champagne. ‘It’s terrifying for river users and it’s making people think twice about going out on the water.’ Another resident, Simon Patterson, 52, said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour would get worse as he gets older. ‘The swan is only young at the moment, we’re concerned he will get stronger and more vicious as he grows bigger,’ he said. Shock: The swan got up close with this woman, whose surprise at what was unfolding in front of her could clearly be seen (right) Making an appearance: The juvenile swan nicknamed Asbaby got far too close for comfort to tourists on the Cam over the Easter weekend . Naughty swan: One resident said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour on the River Cam would get worse as he gets older . ‘He swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way. We thought Mr Asbo and Asboy were bad, but this swan is even worse. ‘It’s very worrying as the river is starting to get busier now, if he continues someone could get really hurt.’ But Colin Sparkes, navigation officer for Conservators of the River Cam, told MailOnline today: ‘Most swans get a bit aggressive this time of year. ‘It's mating season - they protect their territory. As far as I’m aware, it's not causing great problems on the river. ‘Swans this time of year start to look out for their nest, and indeed when the young and born. ‘It’s a very tricky one because the more people feed the swans, the more aggressive they tend to become. Close to the camera: Asbaby 'swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way', according to one local resident . Worrying: Asbaby's actions are said to be 'terrifying for river users' and are 'making people think twice about going out on the water' Threatening: The behaviour of Mr Asbo (above) before he was moved 60 miles three years ago left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises . No longer there: The Cam Conservators moved Mr Asbo about 60 miles away in 2012. His son Asboy is seen above in this file photograph . 'They get used to swimming up to people expecting to be fed.’ He confirmed that there are no plans to remove Asbaby from the river, adding that the case of Mr Asbo was completely different. Mr Sparkes said: ‘That swan (Mr Asbo) was extremely aggressive - it's the most aggressive swan I've ever come across. ‘I believe that was probably down to the way he'd been brought up looking for food from various people.’ The Conservators moved Mr Asbo away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself. His behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises - and a marshal was employed during a university rowing race to stop him injuring students. It has previously been reported how Asboy was seen attacking punters, birds and even a cow. He also injured a canoeist and a swimmer.

The Conservative know that they need to turn large parts of the country blue on May 7. And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate Alec Shelbrooke in Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.

Sheffield Wednesday chief executive Paul Aldridge will leave the Championship club at the end of next season. Aldridge, who has previously worked at West Ham, Leicester City and Manchester City, joined the club as vice chairman and CEO in January 2011. Wednesday have brought in Adam Pearson and Glenn Roeder to work alongside head coach Stuart Gray. Sheffield Wednesday chief executive Paul Aldridge (left) will leave the club at the end of next season . Chairman Dejphon Chansiri said the trio would form 'a three-man sporting director by committee' at Hillsborough. Former Hull City and Derby County owner Pearson will advise on business. Aldridge said: 'I have had a tremendous time at the club and look forward to playing my part next season in what I hope will be a very successful campaign. Glenn Roeder is now part of a new managerial committee team at the Championship outfit . Adam Pearson helped lead Hull to the Premier League and will be hoping he can do the same at Wednesday . 'I am sure by giving the chairman sufficient time to consider who is the right person to lead the club into its 150th anniversary, he will appoint the most suitable successor. 'I know I have a very busy summer ahead, we have at least two major projects starting later this month. Supporters will notice a big difference when they come back at the start of next season and see the new pitch and giant screen. 'I am also hoping to be very busy playing my part in the overhaul of the playing squad, the chairman has made it quite clear he wants to be challenging from the start of the new season.' Stuart Gray is the manager of the club and has done well since taking over from former boss Dave Jones .

After months of speculation - and years of her friends' doubts - Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has admitted she never had cancer. With her business empire destroyed and her online community in tatters, Gibson today admitted her fatal cancer 'diagnoses' were lies. 'No. None of it is true,' she said, during a series of interviews published in the latest edition of the Australian Women's Weekly. In the interviews - which questioned her relationship with the truth and her understanding of cancer - Gibson said she was not seeking forgiveness. 'I don't want forgiveness. I just think (it) was the responsible thing to do. Above anything, I would like people to say, 'Okay, she's human'. Gibson's confession was the first time she has spoken publicly since - under fire from furious former fans - she told Daily Mail Australia she feared for her family's safety. Scroll down for video . Ms Gibson revealed the truth of her cancer diagnosis in an interview . Ms Gibson, pictured kissing her son Olivier, 4, on the head, said: 'None of it was true' Her business empire in tatters and her relationship with her fans broken, Ms Gibson is thought to be struggling financially. The Women's Weekly said she was not paid for her interview . Ms Gibson's interview will be published in this month's edition of the Australian Women's Weekly . The wellness blogger was a prominent Australian social media personality. Her Instagram fan base ballooned after she 'revealed' she had prolonger her life by embracing an alternative lifestyle. Her 'whole foods' business became famously successful. Penguin published her recipe book and her app was to be offered on the Apple Watch. But it all fell apart last month after revelations emerged Ms Gibson had failed to fulfil promised donations to various charities. Friends then began to cast doubts about her cancer diagnoses. She then tearfully 'admitted' she may have been 'misdiagnosed' by a 'Dr Phil'. The  Weekly insists it did not pay for the story and that it was approached by Ms Gibson's 'people', the Melbourne 'corporate advisory' firm Bespoke Approach. Ms Gibson said her partner, Clive Rothwell, was sticking by her in spite of the controversy. But she said he had taken a 'stern' line with her and insisted she play a straight bat. 'He’s been very stern, along the lines of, ‘I just want you to acknowledge where you’ve f***ed up and try not to smooth over that,' she was quoted saying. In the article, titled 'My Lifelong Struggle With The Truth', Ms Gibson also said she had been forced to raise herself from the day she started school. She said she took upon common household responsibilities, such as bringing her brother to school and making lunches. But she would not provide her mother's name or contact details to the magazine. In her previous interview, Ms Gibson said she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion'. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) was also a popular app. It will not appear on the Apple Watch any longer . But she took aim at many of her former fans who she believed had responded 'maliciously' - claiming that her son's childcare details, home address and floor plan were published online. Former friends had called upon Ms Gibson to 'come clean' with the truth about her situation and had long privately questioned the veracity of her story. Authorities told Daily Mail Australia  at the beginning of April that Ms Gibson is still facing an official investigation. A former friend of Ms Gibson directly called on her to 'come clean' in an interview with Daily Mail Australia in March. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want'

A ‘unique and beautiful’ teenage girl was killed by a driver who crashed a stolen car while drunk and high on cocaine and cannabis. Xana Doyle, 19, was a passenger in the Toyota Avensis, which flipped and landed on its roof in an accident in the early hours of the morning. Driver Sakhawat Ali, 23, was more than twice the drink-drive limit and had been taking class A and B drugs before getting behind the wheel. Xana Doyle (pictured) was killed after driver Sakhawat Ali crashed a stolen car while high on drugs . The Toyota Avensis flipped and landed on its roof after the crash in the early hours of the morning in January . A court heard he was driving at ‘excessive speed’ in the moments before the crash, which did not involve any other vehicle. Miss Doyle, who suffered a ‘blunt head injury’, was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales. Ali admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday. Judge Neil Bidder QC told the court: ‘The driver was well over twice the drink-drive limit and it is accepted there was excessive speed.’ The judge said he wanted more information on how much cocaine and cannabis the driver had taken on the night of the smash before sentencing. Ali, of Newport, was remanded in custody ahead of a hearing in July. Sakhawat Ali (pictured right) admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking . The driver’s cousin, Shabaz Ali, 21, admitted allowing himself to be carried in a stolen car following the smash in January this year. The July hearing will decide whether he ‘contributed’ to the accident by pulling the handbrake from the back seat. Floral tributes were left at the scene of the accident and hundreds of people attended the funeral of Miss Doyle, a former Duffryn High School student, in January. In a tribute, her mother Emma O’Donoghue wrote that Xana was an ‘unusual name for a unique and beautiful girl’. Before the crash, Miss Doyle, from Newport, had recently begun working at Wetherspoons as a cook and was also a trained beautician after completing an apprenticeship. Ms O’Donoghue said yesterday: ‘No sentence will ever give me back my daughter or my children their sister. She is dearly missed and this terribly traumatic experience will remain with us for ever. ‘I am pleased that Sakhawat Ali has pleaded guilty, not that he could dispute any of the evidence presented. Miss Doyle suffered a 'blunt head injury' and was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales . Ali was remanded in custody and a hearing in July will determine if his cousin also contributed to the crash . ‘Xana was a beautiful, funny and loving girl and every day is a struggle to live on without her in our lives, we can only hope that justice is served and those responsible are held accountable.’ Paying tribute to Miss Doyle at her funeral, her mother said: ‘You had a smile that would stop this world spinning around. ‘I always knew that you were kind and loving and even through your difficult teenage years you never forgot to tell me how much you loved me and appreciated my support. ‘In the last two years you blossomed into a beautiful young woman, independent and hard-working, making us all so proud of you.’ She added that she had fond memories of her daughter playing and fooling around with her sisters, Lauren and Eve, and her brother Zane. Miss Doyle, whose white coffin was adorned with red roses, gave ‘unquivering friendship and support’ to her friends and family throughout her life, her mother added.

A young woman has managed to find her doppelgänger after launching a campaign on Facebook as a social experiment - and their likeness is mind-blowing. Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old  TV presenter from Dublin, teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed Twin Strangers to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days, and were soon inundated with submissions from all over the world. Incredibly, Niamh found her match in Karen Branigan, 29, a fellow Ireland native who lives just an hour down the road, making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together. Scroll down for video . Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Speaking to MailOnline about her first meeting with Karen, Niamh said: I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the entire duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face, and some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, "Oh my God that’s my face." 'I can’t remember the number of times I said "this is so freaky". It was truly amazing.' Karen, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Niamh has a brother and two sisters, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Niamh said the pair got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities.

'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry says. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!'

It may have been invented for students to use. But youngsters appear to be deserting Facebook in droves because it is now so popular with their parents – and grandparents. Almost a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’. The trend comes as increasing numbers of older users turn to the social network to stay in touch and share family pictures. Nearly 60 per cent of Britons aged over 55 now have a Facebook account, according to research. Facebook has even started running television adverts to entice the so-called ‘silver surfers’ to join. Now a survey of around 2,000 Britons has revealed that it is having the opposite effect on youngsters. ‘As parents are signing up, their children are logging off to maintain privacy,’ said Lord Jim Knight, chairman of online lobby group the Tinder Foundation. In the poll, a third of Facebook users are said to have blocked a family member so they can no longer see their account or do not receive automatic updates. The survey did not take account of the number of youngsters who have effectively blocked their family members by refusing to add them as a ‘Facebook friend’ in the first place. One in ten people aged 16 to 34 signed up to other platforms so they could remain ‘under the radar of their parents’. But whilst youngsters may be leaving Facebook, they are not giving up on social media altogether. More than half said they had joined Twitter, where only 13 per cent of ‘silver surfers’ said they have accounts. Meanwhile, about 40 per cent of youngsters use the picture-sharing website Instagram, according to the study commissioned by Halifax and carried out by Opinium Research. Logging off: Nearly a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their facebook accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’ Around the same proportion use Snapchat, a social media platform which automatically deletes messages shortly after they are sent. The picture was very different among the over-55s. Just three percent have an Instagram account and even fewer – around one percent – use Snapchat. The way people use these different social platforms is also changing. Around a fifth of those aged 16 to 34 use their smartphones at family dinners, posing a threat to the precious mealtimes that used to be the cornerstone on family life. By comparison, just one percent of silver surfers use their smartphones during a meal with their offspring.

Alan Pardew has warned Crystal Palace's Barclays Premier League admirers that if they want to sign Yannick Bolasie this summer then the bidding will have to start at £20million. It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.' Bolasie scores against Sunderland as he helped Crystal Palace beat the struggling Premier League side .

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini accepts his side are now facing a fight to stay in the Champions League places. City appear to have lost too much ground to Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race and their recent form has led to a further worry, with the sides behind them catching fast. The fading champions could even find themselves in fourth place before they next play - at Crystal Palace on Monday - if results go against them over the weekend. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) shakes hands with David Silva during Manchester City training . Martin Demichelis (left), Wilfried Bony (centre) and Fernando during Friday's session . Frank Lampard (right) looks to play a pass as he and his team-mates are put through their paces . This is not a battle they envisaged having to fight at the start of the campaign but Pellegrini realises nothing can be taken for granted after a frustrating second half of the season. Pellegrini said: 'I think in this league you can never be sure you are going to have a Champions League place. You have six or seven teams that, from the beginning, all of them play for that position. 'At the moment, for the whole year, we have been in a position of the Champions League. I hope that we will continue.' Pellegrini believes his side are now in a battle for the Champions League places and not the title . Manchester City have struggled to keep up with Chelsea, who are closing in on the Premier League trophy . The ramifications of dropping out of the top four, however, are not really something Pellegrini wants to consider, given that he still has hopes of landing the title. With just eight games remaining and a significant deficit to make up on Chelsea that looks a forlorn task, but Pellegrini is not giving up. The Chilean said: 'Of course if we want to continue in the first position of the table we must not drop any more points. It is easy to say but not easy to do it. 'We just know that from now until the end of the season we will try to win all the games and we will see if we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end.' Sergio Aguero has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks but will hope to find the net on Monday . James Milner is in line to return after withdrawing from the England squad with a knee problem . City will hope to be at full strength for the trip to Selhurst Park. Pellegrini reported nothing other than 'small problems' when asked about any injury concerns at his pre-match press conference. That means a likely return for key midfielder Yaya Toure, who missed the 3-0 victory over West Brom a fortnight ago with an Achilles problem but has since played for Ivory Coast. Fellow midfielder James Milner has also been troubled by a knee problem in recent weeks - and withdrew from England's midweek friendly in Italy - but the issue is not thought serious.

Radamel Falcao could still sign permanently for Manchester United after it emerged that chief executive Ed Woodward held talks with Monaco on Sunday over the striker’s future. Falcao, who has scored just four times for United since his season-long loan move from Monaco, drew another blank at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea on Saturday evening. But Woodward told Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev last Sunday that they would make a decision on the right to sign him permanently at the end of the season. Manchester United could sign Radamel Falcao permanently after holding talks with Monaco on Sunday . The striker has endured a frustrating season on loan at Man United and has managed just four league goals . Vasilyev said: ‘I saw the Manchester United people last Sunday and they have not yet decided if they would exercise the option.. ‘It’s not his best season, but they kept the opportunity to make a decision at the end of the season.’ Although it seems highly unlikely that United will keep the Colombian striker, Falcao has been given hope of a second chance under Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Under the terms of the original loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the forward, but it has since emerged that Monaco are willing to negotiate on the transfer fee after a disappointing season at United. Vasilyev added: ‘We are not in any other negotiations, even if big clubs are interested. The decision is with Manchester, then we will discuss with the player what he wants. I would like to have more visibility.’ Falcao missed last summer’s World Cup in Brazil following a knee injury and it is thought he rushed his recovery in an attempt to play in the tournament for Colombia. Under the terms of the loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the striker but Monaco are willing to negotiate . Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward spoke with Monaco president Vasim Vasilyev on Sunday . Vasilyev added: ‘He had mishaps in Monaco. He had problems with the coach Claudio Ranieri, there was a lack of understanding. ‘He was also seriously injured and missed the World Cup. In late August, he came to tell us that he wanted to play at a higher level.” Ranieri has since been replaced by Leonardo Jardim and he has backed Falcao to rediscover his goalscoring form after a frustrating season at United. Jardim, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Juventus in the Stade Louis II, is preparing for his return at the end of the season. Jardim, speaking ahead of his side's home clash with Juventus, is confident Falcao can get back to his best . The Portuguese coach said: ‘He’s not had a great season that is true, but I’m sure he can come back to the levels he was at in the past - that much I’m convinced about. ‘It’s not a question for me, but for the players, I’ve only worked with him for a month.’ Monaco lost the first leg last week in the Juventus Stadium to a controversial penalty and face Massimiliano Allegri’s team in the second leg.

An aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed Germanwings passenger plane may had its electronics 'hacked' before it crashed killing all 150 on board. The theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected Financial Times newspaper from aviation boss Matt Andersson, president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace. The French Alps tragedy which occurred on the flight between Barcelona to Dusseldorf has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28. He is believed to have barricaded himself in the cockpit of the GermanWings A320 Airbus before flying the packed plane into the mountainside as the captain fought desperately to get inside. Scroll down for video . Disaster: An aviation expert says an external factor like 'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the Germanwings plane crash that claimed 150 lives . Tragedy: The crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who investigators say locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet . Investigation: But Matt Andersson - president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace - says any number of causes could have caused the crash . Doomed: Recordings from the cockpit suggested that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (left) locked himself in the cockpit while the Captain Patrick Sondenheimer desperately tried to break in . Investigators point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer. Mr Andersson says the French accident investigators are clear that the stricken plane 'accelerated in its descent'. But he writes in the FT: 'That may be, but it could be from any number of causes, including external electronic hacking into the aircraft's control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception.' 'This is one reason military and head-of-state aircraft are generally installed with specific shielding and additional active protective measures,' and he stresses: 'Civilian aircraft are not.' Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries and come to a firm conclusion. He added: 'The public should patiently wait for a through, multi-party professional air safety investigation, while maintaining an independence of judgment over preliminary official hypotheses.' Setting out his doubts about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary findings, Mr Andersson said: 'Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) of the Germanwings flight 9525 have yet to be subject to international standards. 'Until they are, many broad assertions currently presented to the public may turn out to be erroneous, misleading or in some cases lead to improper or counterproductive regulatory and other reactions –including misplaced liability, financial and insurance claims.' Damaged: Despite revelations from the plane's flight data recorders (pictured), Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries . Aftermath: He claims passenger planes do not have the same level of protection as military jets and someone could have hacked into its 'control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception' Since the crash, European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck, requiring a member of cabin crew to step in if one of the two pilots leaves the cockpit. Mr Andersson writes in the FT that the 'slow drip' of piecemeal judgments from preliminary assessments of data can be counterproductive. He said the European Cockpit Association representing nearly 40,000 professional pilots 'has rightly criticised the premature release' of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder. Investigators say this highlights the co-pilot breathing while locked in the cockpit while the pilot beats on the door outside. Protection: Since the crash which is believed to be caused by 28-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck . Police carried out forensic searches on Lubitz's and his parents house after it emerged that he 'deliberately' crashed the Airbus A320 jet into the Alps . He believes premature release 'could arguably prejudice a formal technical assessment' and Mr Andersson is not the only aviation expert to speculate on the plane being 'hacked'. Former commercial pilot Jay Rollins told US television channel MSNBC last month: 'This aircraft is highly computerised. 'There's one possibility that no-one has brought up. I wonder – could this be a hacking incident?' He drew parallels with the loss of a US drone over Iran, which some blamed on electronic hacking: 'Suddenly the aircraft responding to outside forces. 'If something like that were going on it would be very disturbing for the pilot.'

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same "situations" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'

Designer Lilly Pulitzer's family learned that it's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the 'Pink Sunday' rush for the late Ms Pulitzer’s eponymous brand’s brightly-colored, limited edition collaboration at Target. The 250-piece Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the #LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party .

Protesters have demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons during a protest against the gentrification of South London. The store front of its Brixton branch was covered in shattered glass while 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' was spray painted in black across their housing advertisements. A police spokesman confirmed that one man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Thousands of people turned up for the event organised by the Reclaim Brixton group who were demonstrating against local residents and businesses being priced out of the trendy area. One of the event's organisers denounced the violent actions of 'one idiot' but told MailOnline there could be a reason Foxtons - which has a reputation for selling expensive homes - has been 'continuously targeted'. Scroll down for video . Vandal: One vandal smashed the front window of Foxtons Brixton branch (pictured) during a 'wholly peaceful' protest against rising house prices in London . Violent: The lone protester demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons, who have a reputation for selling expensive houses . Defaced: The vandal then spray painted 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' on the estate agent's housing advertisements . Reputation: A spokesperson for Reclaim Brixton - who organised the event - denounced the man's violent actions but suggested there could be a reason Foxtons is 'continuously targeted' Motive: Cyndi Anaso said she is not happy about the vandalism but told MailOnline 'it suggests there's a reason they are being targeted' Response: Police at the scene in Brixton (pictured) had to us CS spray to disperse a group of violent protesters . Cyndi Anaso from Reclaim Brixton told MailOnline said she was 'saddened' that someone behaved 'deviantly' during a wholly peaceful demonstration. But she claims the upmarket estate agents have been targeted before, adding: 'Foxtons has a very poor reputation when it comes to expensive properties and unfortunately.' 'There's a message in it which I'm not happy about but it still suggests there's a reason they are being targeted. 'There's never an endorsement of the attack but nothing else on the day can be considered even slightly violent.' 'I don't even think it's right to apologise for these individuals because every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window.' Foxtons is widely considered as a sign of gentrification and its presence is an indicates that an area either is or has the potential to become very affluent. The Reclaim Brixton event was planned to demonstrate against the rising property prices in London which the group believes is 'displacing the city's communities'. A statement on the Facebook page for the event said: 'The fight against gentrification starts here! Brixton is widely known for its vibrancy, which is another word for social and cultural diversity. Keeping watch: There is still a 'police presence' outside the vandalised store in Brixton, South London following the incident . Defence: Sympathisers and Brixton locals used Twitter to condemn the attention being given to the 'isolated' act of vandalism . Break-in: The Metropolitan Police (pictured) also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall, but were removed shortly after and no arrests were made . 'But Brixton's vibrancy now has a question mark on it. Will Brixton turn into a living museum or will it live?' But alongside images of people protesting peacefully on the streets, social media has been flooded with images of hordes pushing past police and the Foxtons window being destroyed. A police spokesman added: 'A group of protesters then made their way to Brixton Road where the window of a commercial premises was smashed and graffiti sprayed on the building.' Police used CS spray on 'a small group of protesters' who went into Brixton Police Station at around 4.10pm before being removed shortly afterwards. The Metropolitan Police also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall at around 3.15pm, saying: 'Officers entered the building and the protesters were removed.' Grace Lally from Lambeth Housing Activists said the demonstration had attracted thousands of people. Smashed: A Reclaim Brixton spokesperson said: 'Every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window' She added: 'The protest has been lively and strong and loud and people have hung banners off the town hall, blocked the streets and marched through Brixton a number of times and stopped traffic.' Ms Lally insisted the protest was 'really lively' but there had been 'no violence or trouble or anything like that'. Those sympathetic to Reclaim Brixton's protest and locals of the area have taken to Twitter to denounce isolated incidents of violence. Regarding the smashed window, Vanessa Furey from London said: 'Whilst sympathetic to the sentiment, idiots who have done this will have taken away what Reclaim Brixton was about.' And Louise Ridley wrote: 'I live in Brixton. I want people to know about extortionate rents and evictions. But I don't want windows smashed, anywhere.'

(CNN)Pushed to his limits, a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class. In an email to his students, Irwin Horwitz accused them of "backstabbing, game playing, cheating, lying, fighting." The professor at the Texas A&M University Galveston Campus expected his missive would create some conflict, but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly. Those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage. The story went viral. Suddenly, his name was spreading on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, accompanied by the kind of strong, unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you've never met. He was a hero who taught today's entitled youth a much-needed lesson, or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit. One thing was certain: He, and his employer, were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for. "I did what I did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the Internet," Horwitz said. "I will stand by what I did, but I'm not career suicidal." Texas A&M says Horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching. But Horwitz, a nontenure-track professor in the maritime administration program, is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs. Horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial, and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class. The day before writing to his students, Horwitz wrote a similar email to the CEO of the Texas A&M Galveston Campus and to the school's chief academic officer. "I have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful, dishonest and disrespectful" as his current strategic management class, he wrote to the administrators. He accused the students of shirking responsibility, making excuses and complaining their way to better grades. He would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class, Horwitz wrote. "The class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic," he wrote. "But they are your problem now." It was the next day that Horwitz wrote to the students, calling the class "an embarrassment in general," and said that "I am frankly and completely disgusted." Once his words echoed in traditional and social media, the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone. The story was such a talker that even The Onion offered a parody. "I'm not looking to fail students," Horwitz said. "I don't get a bonus for failing students." "The letter sounded a little bit more definite than I wanted it to," he added. He never actually changed anyone's grade. There were some students he wasn't going to fail, he said, and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out. But Horwitz stands by his tough stance; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed, he said. The course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses. "I had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break-even analysis," the professor said. "If you cannot do a break-even analysis, then you don't deserve a bachelor's degree in business." His other complaint was about professionalism. Horwitz said students would swear at him, cheat and spread rumors about him online. This is related to their grades, he said, because dealing with people you don't like is a business skill. On online message boards, users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story. One purported student called Horwitz "a little obnoxious," but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules. Should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral? The fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public, but maybe there is more to it. The situation hits on a popular argument on the media and Internet: What do we think of millennials? Reflecting on his most recent class, Horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered. He mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics, and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration. The other factor is a failure of K-12 education, said Horwitz, who has met college students who don't know how to convert fractions to decimals. "What I'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance," he said. In a statement, Patrick Louchouarn, the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at Texas A&M Galveston Campus, said the entire class will not be failed. "Each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester," Louchouarn said. "The university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies." The flurry of attention is unwelcome and Horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia. But it's likely his story will have a short shelf life. People probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline. But he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere. He said he feels a public shaming of sorts. Online public shaming has become a research topic of its own. People who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance. "This is really destroying my life," Horwitz said.

A northern Indiana pizzeria that closed after its owner said his religious beliefs wouldn't allow him to cater a gay wedding opened Thursday to a full house of friends, regulars and people wanting to show their support. 'It's a relief to get going again and try to get back to normal,' said Kevin O'Connor, owner of Memories Pizza. O'Connor closed the shop for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana. Scroll down for video . Full house: Many customers wait for service as Memories Pizza reopened for business on Thursday. A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours . Owner Kevin O'Connor closed the shop (seen on Tuesday)  for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law . O'Connor, the  61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming . O'Connor said the criticism hasn't changed his beliefs. He said gays are welcome in his restaurant in the small, one-traffic-light town of Walkerton, 20 miles southwest of South Bend, but that he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his Christian beliefs. 'I'd do the same thing again. It's my belief. It's our belief. It's what we grew up on,' he said. 'I'm just sorry it comes to this because neither one of us dislike any of those people. I don't hold any grudges.' A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours. O'Connor said he hasn't received the money yet, but said he plans to give some to charity and use some money to make improvements to the restaurant. The 61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. 'I enjoy it. I don't want to leave here,' he said. 'I want this to be something that my daughter can enjoy.' Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming. Anger: A protester is seen outside Memories Pizza in this photo with a sign that reads 'Bigots' Uproar: Protesters (like the ones seen here on March 28) have been upset over Indiana passing a new law, which critics said allows businesses the ability to refuse service to gay customers on religious grounds. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana . Family: O'Connor, seen with his daughter Crystal, says gays are welcome in his restaurant, but he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his beliefs . The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. O'Connor says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders . 'We were like, `Stop! Stop! Stop!'" she said. 'It was really making us uncomfortable,' her father said. The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. He says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders. There were no protests as of 7 p.m. Jeanne and Ken Gumm from outside LaPorte, about 20 miles northwest of Walkerton, said they had been waiting for the pizzeria to reopen so they could show their support. 'We couldn't wait to get down here," said Ken Gumm, 66, a tank truck driver. 'To us this whole thing isn't about gay marriage. It's mostly about freedom of religion.'

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today left the door open to a second referendum on Scottish independence before 2020. Before last year's historic vote, Scottish nationalists insisted it was a once-in-a-generation chance to decided on the future of the 300-year-old Union. But Ms Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' In September's vote, 55 per cent of Scots backed the idea of remaining in the United Kingdom. Alex Salmond said the vote was an 'opportunity of a lifetime' and two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: 'We have always said it's a once in a generation thing.' But in a series of TV election debates between Scottish leaders, Ms Sturgeon has shifted her position and today left open the possibility that the promise of another vote could be included in a future SNP manifesto. Under pressure she said that 'something would have to change' before she promised a referendum, and people would have to vote for it. She said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, there is not another referendum on the cards. 'In order for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future, something significant would have to change from the situation we had last year in the referendum.' Ms Sturgeon, who was campaigning in Paisley today, left open the idea of demanding a referendum in next year's Scottish Parliament elections . Opponents claim Ms Sturgeon had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on a referendum, after insisting last year's vote was a once in a generation event . During a fractious and at times shouty debate on BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged her to rule out another vote. Ms Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: 'You clearly don't want to tell people before they vote in this election, what will happen in the next election. 'You have a conference coming up in September, you have 80,000 new members who might be popping along, are you going to put a motion at your conference on this to put a referendum into your next manifesto?' Ms Sturgeon said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, I haven't published the 2016 manifesto. It will be this time next year before we publish the 2016 one.' Mr Rennie said the SNP leader had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on another referendum. He said: 'People need to know whether their vote for the SNP this time round will trigger a referendum in the SNP's manifesto in 2016. Nicola Sturgeon's refusal to answer this basic question makes clear that Scotland faces neverendum. 'It matters because during the referendum we know the SNP took their eye off the ball. As a result, public services were neglected. 'We have seen from Canada the economic impact of an uncertain constitutional environment. Quebec lost jobs and wealth. That damaged the province in the long term. I want a Scotland which builds a stronger economy and a fairer society, balancing the books and delivering more powers.' During a TV debate, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged Ms Sturgeon to come clean on her plans for Scotland . Ms Sturgeon later accused her opponents of 'reviving Project Fear'. The First Minister was questioned about SNP plans to increase Scotland's financial powers, which economists have suggested would leave a £7.6 billion spending gap, during a third televised election debate in under a week. Ms Sturgeon said that full fiscal autonomy would take several years to implement but with new powers Scotland would start growing its economy and revenues. She said: 'This week we've seen the Project Fear that dominated the referendum revived by these three unionist parties, trying to talk down Scotland and assert that we're not capable of running our own affairs.' Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said: 'This (the figure) didn't come from us. You're right in saying this came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It also came from a group of Scottish-based economists that projected the gap to be bigger.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: 'To make this £7.6 billion up Scotland would have to grow at twice the rate of the rest of entire advanced world, so how would you do that Nicola?'

A night of violence gave way to a day of mourning Sunday for a man who died after sustaining serious injuries while in the custody of Baltimore police. Over several hours on Sunday afternoon, a steady stream of mourners filed into the Vaughn Green East funeral home for a wake for Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who died a week after an encounter with police left him with grave spinal injuries. Mourners passed by Gray's silk-draped, white coffin where he lay dressed in a white shirt, black pants, white sneakers and an all-white Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap. Scroll down for video .

Above the lid to the coffin was a floral arrangement and inside the lid was a pillow with a screen-printed picture of Gray flanked by doves and the quote, 'Peace, Y'all' at the bottom edge. Mourners also gathered outside. Some held up signs that read, 'We remember Freddie' and 'Our Hearts Are With The Gray Family.' Melissa McDonald, 36, who said she was Gray's cousin, wore a shirt with 'Freddie Forever' printed on the back. She described her cousin as a nonviolent person. 'He didn't deserve to die the way he did,' she said. A number of mourners like Tina Covington, 46, said they didn't know the family but came to express their condolences. Covington said she has a son near Freddie Gray's age. Gray was detained on April 12 after he ran away from police. He asked for an inhaler as he screamed in pain during the arrest and requested medical attention, but was denied . Gray, who was arrested for carrying a switchblade knife, died a week after the incident from a severed spine . 'It hits home. It really does. It's a reality check,' said Covington, whose son is 27. Covington said that 'there is something going on in the police department that needs to change.' Gray's funeral is planned for Monday. At a church service earlier Sunday, Pastor Jamal Bryant told churchgoers, including members of Gray's family, at Empowerment Temple AME Church that 'somebody is going to have to pay' for Gray's death. Bryant told churchgoers that if 'you're black in America your life is always under threat.' Bryant also talked about the violence that erupted Saturday night during what began as a peaceful demonstration attended by more than a thousand people.

Some 34 people were arrested, according to Baltimore Police Department, and six police officers sustained minor injuries. J.M. Giordano, a photo editor at Baltimore's City Paper, said Baltimore police beat him as he covered one of the protests in west Baltimore. A video posted to the newspaper's website Sunday shows at least two police officers in riot gear hitting and kicking Giordano as the person filming screams, 'He's a photographer! He's press!' Sait Serkan Gurbuz, a photographer with Reuters, said police detained him as he was shooting photographs of the scuffle. He declined to comment further. A statement from Reuters said police also cited Gurbuz for failure to obey orders. 'We hope that the department will dismiss the citation and, going forward, respect the First Amendment right of the press to lawfully take images in the public interest,' Reuters said. Gray's wake was held a day after protests in Baltimore turned violent. Above, a man is kicked as he attempts to get up after being knocked down, following a march to City Hall on Saturday . Barricade: Police stand in helmets near Pratt Street after a march to City Hall for Freddie Gray, Saturday, April 25, 2015 in Baltimore . Roughly 1,200 protesters gathered at City Hall on Saturday afternoon, officials said, to protest Gray's death, which has prompted near-daily demonstrations since he died April 19. Gray was arrested one week before that when officers chased him through a West Baltimore neighborhood and dragged him into a police van. However, a smaller group splintered off and looted a convenience store and smashed storefront windows. A protester tossed a flaming metal garbage can toward police officers in riot gear trying to push back the crowd. Earlier, a group of protesters smashed windows of at least three police cars. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a long-time congressman representing Baltimore's 7th District, told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that there is deep frustration over the case. 'Mr. Gray died a week ago. And I think the thing that upset so many people was the fact that here's a young man. We still don't know exactly why he was arrested,' Cummings said. 'We do know that he was hollering out for aid. He was not given aid after being arrested. ... A lot of people are very, very frustrated as to trying to figure out what happened here, and it's very upsetting.'

Gathering at the ball game: Protestors gather outside of Oriole Park at Camden Yards before a baseball game between the Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles after a rally for Freddie Gray, Saturday, April 25, 2015, in Baltimore . Police acknowledged Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested — before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the Police Department's policy. Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray asked for medical help several times, beginning before he was placed in the van. After a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.

A volleyball-playing feline was picked to star in a national TV advert after seeing off competition from thousands of gifted animals. Tortoiseshell Mimi became an internet sensation after her owner uploaded clips of her playing the sport to Facebook. The 30-second-video was shared by thousands of people around the world and features the one-year-old cat playing with 15-year-old Joshua Teague. Joshua’s dad Phil, 56, a computer programmer, bought the cat with his wife Christine, 45, when she was eight-weeks-old in December 2013 from a seller who lived in Birmingham. Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert, which was broadcast last Wednesday (15), after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group earlier this month. He said: 'All the family were really excited to see the advert. Mimi the cat appears in a 30-second video showing her unique ball skills . 'We had everyone around so we could watch it together and we told all our friends that it was going to be on. 'I am really proud that our video was chosen out of thousands of entries. 'It was completely by chance that I uploaded the video on to the Pets At Home Facebook page. The cat is seen playing volleyball with 15-year-old Joshua Teague in the hallway . Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group . 'I just saw something on there asking people to share videos and pictures of their pets so that’s what I did. I didn’t even realise it was a competition. 'The video showed Mimi playing volleyball with my son where he would throw the ball at her and she would keep batting it back. 'I had no idea it was competition so I thought it was a joke when I received an email on April 1 saying our video had been chosen for a national commercial. Mimi is seen in the video batting the ball back to Joshua every time he throws it her way . 'This kind of thing just never happens. 'She is a very talented cat. She has done many times since. 'I think she could get her own TV show.' Administrative assistant Christine said: 'I didn’t even know Phil had uploaded the video on Facebook so I thought it was an April Fools’ joke when he told me about it. 'We normally just skip the adverts when we watch programmes but we made sure to watch this one. 'Although she’s only in the advert for a few seconds, it’s nice to see her on it. 'I never thought when I filmed the video that it would end up on TV.'

Controversial Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans is under attack again with experts warning his 'reworked' baby milk formula is dangerous to babies. Dietitians have singled out a 'happy tummy brew' in Evans' cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, because it contains almost five times the maximum vitamin A dose for a baby. The original recipe for the 'brew' contained more than 10 times the maximum daily intake of vitamin A for babies. Scroll down for video . The paleo diet has been one of the hottest diet trends around, with celebrity followers taking on the lifestyle . The Dieticians Association of Australia said the reworked formula still presents a threat to babies. 'This new infant 'brew' could seriously harm babies,' a spokeswoman for the Dieticians Association of Australia told News Corp Australia. 'The authors seem to have made a serious mistake with this second version of their liver and broth recipe, suggesting they do not understand the basic scientific and nutrition information relevant for infant feeding. 'They have said publicly that they have tried to make it safe by reworking the original recipe, and increasing the age for which it's suggested from 0-6 months to now be 6-12 months, but they have failed spectacularly to meet any safe standards.' The paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle . Evans's co-authors, wellness blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padrin, told Channel 7 last week the dangerous formula had been reworked and renamed 'Happy Tummy Brew'. The pair told the program the recipe had changed. 'We added vitamin C and some calcium,'Carr told The Morning Show. It comes after Evans' recently shared two stories on his social media accounts of women who claimed the paleo diet helped alleviate the symptoms of their multiple sclerosis. A 30-year-old woman, Hollie, wrote she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in September 2013. She said that she endured months of  constant dizziness, altered temperature perception, extreme fatigue, numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression. But after jumping on the Paleo diet bandwagon, Hollie claimed she has not suffered any MS symptoms over the past 12 months, her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever. Hollie's experience led the celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000-plus followers on Facebook on Saturday. Pete Evans has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis . 'WOW this is powerful story on MS, thanks for sharing Hollie.. it will make your heart sing.. it has mine, please tag and share wide!' Evans wrote. The Australian chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg, another MS sufferer. The woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on Evans' 10 weeks Paleo program. The celebrity chef has been a proud paleo advocate . 'I have had a lot of health issues the past years, mainly auto-immune stuff including MS,' she wrote in the online post. 'Having MS means I'm always sapped of energy, have numbness, pins and needles, pain, poor concentration, etc. Not any more!' Marg said she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs. 'No way on earth I could have done that 10 weeks ago,' she wrote. 'My concentration and memory is much better and I can also plan better. I'm not off my MS meds yet but I am off my Thyroid and Reflux meds. 'Thanks so much Pete and team for helping me get my life back. You've made this road so easy. As an added bonus I've gone from a size 16 to a size 12.' The My Kitchen Rules judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy. But, Hollie praised Evans for his endorsement of the controversial diet, and said 'the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable'. 'I have been inspired by your encouragement, great recipes and educated by the accurate information you provide,' Hollie wrote. 'Pete, I thank you so very much for bringing paleo in to the mainstream - people no longer look at me as though I'm a weirdo for following this way of life.' In another recent Facebook post, the Australian chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg who also suffers from MS . Evans has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman 'diet' LaTrobe University Associate Professor of Dietetics Catherine Itsiopoulos pointed out Hollie's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the Paleo lifestyle. 'Her diet may have been poor previously,' Dr Itsiopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we don't know what her diet and eating habits were like before. 'By eating lean meat, good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together. 'But we don't actually know if her condition is cured so it's hard to advocate on because there's no scientific evidence to back this up.' The paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar . University of South Australia Professor of Population, Health and Nutrition Kerin O'Dea said while the diet seemed to have worked for Hollie, it might not work for others. 'Pete can share whatever he likes to his followers but there's never going to be one magic bullet to cure an illness or a serious disease,' Dr O'Dea told Daily Mail Australia. 'Someone reporting an anecdote might be true in one person's case but it's very difficult to imply it to others, which can be quite misleading for people. The paleo style of eating, which Pete Evans is a proud supporter of, has been sweeping across the globe . 'They could feel failure when it doesn't work for them, especially when they try to cure a serious condition like this. 'I wouldn't recommend any particular diet for anyone suffering any type of illnesses.' The paleo style of eating, which Evans is a proud supporter of, has swept  the globe and involves a high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruits, seeds and nuts.

(CNN)A popular Chinese television host known for impromptu satire is now the subject of controversy after being caught on camera cursing the late Chairman Mao Zedong. Bi Fujian, who works for state-run China Central Television, was filmed at a dinner party singing a revolutionary song that eulogizes the Communist Party's early years when he started going off script. "The Communist Party, Chairman Mao. Don't mention that old son of a b***h. He made us suffer so bad," went Bi's improvised lyrics. The other dinner guests burst into laughter. Bi later apologized. "My personal speech has led to grave social consequences, and I feel remorseful for that. I hereby sincerely apologize to the public. As a public figure, I shall learn the lesson from this incident, adhering to strict self-discipline," he posted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform. Making disrespectful references to China's leaders in public is considered a taboo in China, even today. And Bi's comment was directed at the man regarded by many as the country's founding father -- despite his controversial reputation. The 75-second video clip, seemingly filmed on the cellphone of another dinner guest, was uploaded on Monday. Since then, it has been removed from video-sharing sites inside China, although it was still accessible on Weibo. It's unclear when the incident occurred, or what the relationsip was between the camera person and Bi. CCTV said it would investigate. "As a CCTV presenter, Bi Fujian's speech in the online video has led to grave social consequences," the network said in a statement posted on its Weibo account. CCTV did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Fondly known as "Grandpa Bi," the 56-year-old TV personality was born and grew up in the Mao era. The song Bi riffed on was part of a "red" Peking opera that was first performed in the late 1950s. It was popularized during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s -- which was launched by Mao -- when China was torn apart by violence and social unrest. The video quickly divided China's online community. Critics said Bi, as an influential public figure, deserved a harsh punishment. But others rushed to his defense, arguing that Bi was simply enjoying himself in a private setting and was set up by whoever uploaded the clip. The video also emerged just a day before the new head of CCTV started his job, leading some to wonder if it were a case of "a new broom sweeps clean." Mao still divides opinion in China. His giant portrait hangs on Beijing's Tiananmen Gate, and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital. But despite this reverence, Mao's is a deeply flawed legacy. Many remember him as a brutal dictator who inspired fear, paranoia and famine, and whose actions resulted in tens of millions of deaths. CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report.

Less than two days later Marissa Holcomb was fired . Hold up: The robber managed to get $400 cash from the till, which Popeyes said is too much money to have kept in the register. They said it is not the first time Holcomb had got in trouble for not clearing the till . 'I just had a gun to me. I'm not paying the money,' Holcomb told KHOU.

A man vying to become the next Kentucky governor has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after a late local celebrity who bid five times for the title but never won enough votes. The 68-year-old Pulaski County resident, who was known as Terrill Wayne Newman until Tuesday, told the Lexington Herald-Leader he doesn't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will 'warm Galbraith's grave.' His predecessor, who died in 2012 from chronic emphysema, gained a following for his wit, sharp dress sense and support of legalizing marijuana. Terrill Wayne Newman (right), who is vying to become Governor of Kentucky, has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after the late local celebrity (left) who bid five times for the title but never won . The newly-christened Galbraith filed paperwork on Wednesday to run as an independent for the state's highest office. The Secretary of State's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by August 11 to get their names on the general election ballot. Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said. Galbraith says he and the late Galbraith were 'not friends per se,' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis. Dea Riley, who was the original Galbraith's running mate in 2011, said she thinks he would find the whole name change amusing. 'I can hear him now: "I'll tell the IRS to send him the tax bill,"' Riley said. But she also said the new Galbraith 'has very big shoes to fill' with his name and she hopes he will honor it. 'To have Gatewood's name and message prostituted, for the sake to garner political office, is a personal affront to me in that I was not only his running mate but equally his friend and confidant,' Riley said.

There looked to be so much bend on Leo Messi’s shot on the half hour at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night that if there had been no net to stop the ball it would kept on curling until it ended up back at the great man’s feet. The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted. Barcelona star duo Luis Suarez (right) and Lionel Messi embrace as Barcelona take a seven-point lead in La Liga . The Barcelona No 10 loses his markers in the Almeria penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike . Barcelona talisman Messi wheels away after opening the scoring  at the Nou Camp during a 4-0 victory over Almeria . Suarez followed Messi's lead by scoring a similar left-footed strike to double the Catalans lead with the first of his two goals . Barcelona defender Marc Bartra stuffs the ball under his shirt after netting a third with a headed goal on 75minutes . Barcelona (4-3-3): Bravo; Alves, Bartra, Mascherano, Adriano; Sergi Roberto, Xavi, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Pedro. Subs: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Mathieu, Pique, Iniesta, Rafinha, Neymar . Booked: Mascherano . Scorer: Messi 33', Suarez 55', Bartra 75', Suarez 90' Almeria (4-2-3-1): Julian; Ximo Navarro, Marin, Trujillo, Casado; Partey, Corona; Wellington Silva (Soriano), Espinosa (Mane), Edgar (Zongo); Bifouma. Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Julián Cuesta in the visitors’ goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Barça number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta’s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo’s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta’s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes.

Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria’s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona’s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury. If they don’t do you with the magic of Messi and Suarez then they do you from a dead ball. Almeria had succumbed to all three threats.

Sandra Garratt was in constant agony after undergoing two operations before her death . A grandmother racked with constant pain jumped from the top of a multi-storey car park to end her suffering, her devastated husband has said. Sandra Garratt, 56, went through two years of agony following two back operations for a slipped disc and not even morphine could dull the pain. Last month doctors told the housewife there was nothing more they could do ease her suffering and this was the 'final straw', according to her husband Steve. On Good Friday, the mother of two left her home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after telling her husband she was 'just popping out'. But he became anxious for her welfare and he called the police. At 2.35pm, police and ambulance crews were called to the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, where they discovered Mrs Garratt's body. She had fallen more than 50ft from the top of an Asda supermarket multi-storey car park. Mr Garratt, 57, told how he gave up his job as a community transport driver last year to care for his wife. He said her suffering had intensified in the last 18 months of her life and the pain had spread to her legs, feet and fingers. He added: 'She was in pain every minute of every day. She was a happy lovely person but withdrew from her happy family life. 'Before there had been hope but when there was nothing they could do, it was the final straw. 'Everybody says the same – she is now free from the pain. That's the only bit of comfort. 'The doctors and GPs, within the scope of the NHS waiting lists and everything that goes on, did everything they could.' Mrs Garratt leaves behind daughter Lucy, 37, son Jonathan, 26, and two grandchildren, Joshua and Jessica. The coroner has been informed of her death. Mrs Garratt told her husband she was 'popping out' on Good Friday. Hours later her body was found at the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, West Midlands .

A young Star Wars fan, who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies’ creator George Lucas asking whether he would allow Jedi Knights to marry in the future, was elated to receive a reply granting his request. Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric told Inside Edition: 'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy was on hand to film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son, who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It’s very black and white. There’s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don’t have emotions, but they do. It’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'

The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 at auction. The unique psychedelic cartoon, which is hand-painted, depicts the eponymous submarine from the 1968 film in which the Fab Four travel to Pepperland to save it from the Blue Meanies. The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas, Texas, on Thursday . The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the Yellow Submarine film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The 1968 film starred The Beatles (above) It features handwritten notes instructing artists on the correct colours to use when recreating the submarine. More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch £10,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time. Yellow Submarine was a success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album a year later . The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. The original cel is set to sell for £10,000 . 'It is a film that has stood the test of time and is as relevant today as when it was made in 1968. The Band Concert is the most expensive cel sold . The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported £280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference. 'It would be one of the earliest final versions of the Yellow Submarine hand-painted - it really is the holy grail of Yellow Submarine memorabilia. 'Since small stickers were used for when the sub travelled there are not really a great deal of Yellow Submarine cels out there. 'This comes from a former Yellow Submarine ink and paint department employee. 'It is an unusually large image. Colour model cels were used also to help determine the final approved colour scheme of the yellow submarine. 'Colour model cels from this film are very rare, and this is one of the single best cels of the Yellow Submarine we have seen.' The Animation Art Signature Auction will take place in Dallas, Texas on April 9.

A terminally-ill landlord whose dying wish was to marry his partner of 26 years saw their special day descend into farce after a series of blunders. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home. But, instead of having the magical day they had planned, the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly. Guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over, and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather, 54, after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple's special day (pictured) was full of blunders . Guests at the couple's (pictured) wedding were forced to listen to the song 'Wonderful Life' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on, rendering it invalid . Mr Haigh, who died weeks after the ceremony in November last year, was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he'd let her down. In fact, the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House in the city centre, where the pair said their vows. Mrs Haigh, 54, said: 'Geoff was heartbroken by it all. He kept apologising to me and saying he'd wished we'd got married years earlier and done it properly. 'He was devastated, as the way he saw it, this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness.' The couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once Mr Haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal. However, the landlord of The Ram's Head pub, in Oldham, was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely. The pair then settled upon the Manchester venue as it was not too far from their home. It took three people two hours to get Mr Haigh ready for his big day and, determined to make the day perfect for his bride-to-be, he battled through pain to make it to the venue. Mrs Haigh, 54, said every guest at the ceremony -  held in November last year in Manchester  -  wrote a letter of complaint. She has three marriage certificates (pictured) as the first two were riddled with errors . The couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony (pictured) and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date. An amended version posted later was full spelling errors . However, it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began. They said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down. Then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows, which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar. Mrs Haigh, a mother of three, said: 'There was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after I asked I was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day. Geoff Haigh and his wife Heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day. 'It felt like they were merely using us a practice go, like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them.' After the bride and groom said their vows, guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music 'Wonderful Life' while the registrar went out of the room. Unbelievably, almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before Mrs Haigh was compelled to take action. She said: 'Everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on. We couldn't believe it. 'It had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now.' After the ceremony, as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant San Carlos, the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate. They were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected, otherwise their marriage was invalid. Mrs Haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead. However, when the second certificate arrived in the post, it was addressed to Mrs Haigh in her maiden name 'Taylor' and included spelling errors on the document. A third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple. Mr Haigh (above) passed away in January this year, just weeks after his wedding to long-term partner Heather. The couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year . Mrs Haigh (left) said her new husband (right) was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down. She has received £137 from the Manchester register office following the calamity day . Mrs Haigh said: 'It felt like they didn't recognise we were married and that really hurt Geoff before he died. 'It made if feel like the whole thing didn't happen, like it meant nothing at all. It was devastating. 'The guests were all in tears for us. They were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously.' The newlyweds were offered a £137 refund but Mrs Haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough 'loss' to warrant compensation. She said: 'It wasn't about the money, but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband. 'It was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more. They said "we all make mistakes and we are only human". 'That's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man's dying wish and the most special day of our lives, that attitude is not acceptable.' The wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House (pictured)  in the city centre, where the pair said their vows . The family has since received an apology from Manchester City Council, which runs the register office based at Heron House. A spokesman said: 'I'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs Taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations. 'These types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious. They understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding.' However, tragically, Mr Haigh died on January 4 this year before receiving the apology. His wife added: 'Geoff was determined not to die over Christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come, and he didn't want that for us. The energy it took from him to hang on, I couldn't believe.'

Washington (CNN)This week is the 100th anniversary of what many historians acknowledge as the Armenian genocide -- the Turkish massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians . And it's also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word "genocide" to describe the atrocity. It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word "genocide" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a "genocide" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago . In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. "The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence," he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. "We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians . In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. "No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on," she wrote.

Jailed millionaire Robert Durst pleaded not guilty Tuesday to the newest charge against him - a federal charge of possessing a gun after a felony conviction. U.S. District Judge Lance Africk set a trial date for June 22. Durst is an estranged member of the wealthy family that operates 1 World Trade Center. He also faces a murder charge in California and two state weapons charges in Louisiana - one of possessing a .38-caliber revolver after a felony conviction and one of possessing the firearm along with an illegal drug: about 5 ounces of marijuana. Claiming innocence: Suspected murderer Robert Durst appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to a new charge of gun possession. Pictured above leaving federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana in handcuffs after the court appearance . Durst pleaded guilty to two federal charges in Pennsylvania in 2004: possessing a firearm while a fugitive and while under indictment. However, his lawyers say those convictions don't make it illegal for him to carry a gun under Louisiana law. The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of 55-year-old Susan Berman, a longtime friend -allegedly because she was going to talk to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. He was arrested early March 15, less than 12 hours before HBO aired the final segment of 'The Jinx,' in which - off camera in a bathroom but with the microphone still live - Durst whispers, 'There it is. You're caught!' After about 10 other short sentences and disjointed phrases, he says, 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' Durst was arrested last month on suspicion of the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. The two pictured together above . It's believed that Durst killed Berman because she was about to speak to investigators about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife Kathleen McCormack. Pictured together above . Tuesday's hearing had its own bizarre moment when prosecutor Mike McMahon asked Durst if he understood the maximum penalties he faced if convicted. Durst responded: 'And you are?' Durst's attorney and the judge then explained to him who McMahon was. Durst is being held without bail in a state prison where the Orleans Parish mental ward is located, because the sheriff's office says experts found him a suicide risk. Defense attorneys and prosecutors met with a different federal judge last week to discuss another federal matter: whether two FBI agents and a state trooper on an FBI task force should be held in contempt of court for failing to show up at a hearing last week before the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court magistrate. Federal prosecutors moved that part of the case to federal court Monday; Durst's attorneys have not filed their response and have said they would not comment until they do. Durst's lawyers say his arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the conclusion of 'The Jinx.' Durst had registered at the Marriott under the name Everette Ward and was lying low while HBO aired the final chapter of his life story. Authorities said they found a passport, a head-and-chest latex mask, a handgun and marijuana in his room. His lawyers say it was searched illegally.

A Montana judge who was censured by the state's high court for his comments about a 14-year-old rape victim has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that former state District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors. Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher. Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. At Rambold's August 2013 sentencing, Baugh said Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold, the Billings Gazette reported at the time. Baugh, per the newspaper, described the teenage girl as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth. Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. Scroll down for video . Selected: Former District Judge G. Todd Baugh has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. He sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that a 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher . Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence. Legal case: Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez (right) shared some responsibility for her rape by teacher Stacey Rambold (left) Baugh, who served almost 30 years as a state judge, stepped down last year after being censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days. He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he didn't know who nominated him for the achievement award. He also repeated his assertion that media reports about the rape case had not told the whole story. 'I'm not trying to say I didn't make any mistakes. If you go into all the mistakes that were made, it would give a better-balanced report,' Baugh said. Fehr said Baugh had been nominated for the award by members of the bar association, but she declined to say who that was or why he was chosen.

He was also censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days . Marian Bradley, Northwest regional director for the National Organization for Women, said the award was inappropriate given Baugh's conduct on the bench. Regardless of his prior accomplishments, Bradley said the Rambold case cannot be overlooked. 'The last chapter in his career, he put himself out there and did not protect a young girl and did not protect a community,' Bradley said. 'Giving him a lifetime achievement award is going to send people into tailspins.' Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. In December, state District Judge Russell Fagg wrote in a column for the Billings Gazette that Baugh handled more than 30,000 cases in his career. 'He has made thousands of good calls, and a few bad calls, as have all of us,' Fagg wrote. 'Bottom line: Baugh is a wonderful person.'

Kelly Ripa has been grief stricken following the sad news that her friend, cosmetic surgeon Dr Fredric Brandt, was found dead by suicide at his Miami mansion on Sunday. So it's understandable that 44-year-old TV star was looking morose as she left her New York City apartment on Tuesday. The Live With Kelly & Michael co-host, who is usually seen smiling, wore a frown as she left the building alone. When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life.' Sad day: Kelly Ripa looked to be in mourning on Tuesday as she left her NYC apartment; on Sunday it was announced her surgeon friend Dr Fredric Brandt had died . The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice.' The former soap opera actress was dressed casually in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on. The beauty was carrying her coat as well as some papers, a cell phone and her purse.

Madonna and Stephanie Seymour were clients. 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer,' the star wrote. Her husband Mark Consuelos, retweeted choreographer Isaac Calpito's post, which read: 'Devastated over the loss of our dear friend @drfredricbrandt. You are missed. You are loved. The world has lost one of its kindest souls.' They were close: Dr  Brandt was remembered by  Ripa (left with the surgeon in 2011) in a tweet on Monday following his tragic suicide at his Miami home on Sunday . Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.' The City of Miami Police Department confirmed that Dr Brandt's death on Sunday was a suicide by hanging. An autopsy was scheduled on Monday, the coroner confirmed. Miami Herald columnist, Lesley Abravanel had said Brandt had been 'devastated' recently over rumors comparing him to a character on the Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Her note: The 44-year-old beauty's tweet said, 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer' Abravanel, a Miami Herald columnist, posted a series of tweets on Sunday claiming that he had been 'devastated' by unflattering comparisons to Dr Franff on the  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, according to  sources close to the doctor. The doctor's longtime publicist Jacquie Tractenberg told The New York Post on Monday: 'The show definitely deeply hurt him, he was being made fun of because of the way he looks. 'It is mean, and it was bullying. But the show was not the reason for his depression, and it was not the reason he would take his own life.' The Tractenberg & Co PR agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. Was he bullied?: Dr  Brandt (left) has a resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly 'devastated' by the portrayal . His colleague, Dr Robert Anolik, who worked with Brandt at his practice, posted a moving tribute on Monday. The acclaimed dermatologist wrote: 'Dr. Fredric Brandt died yesterday. For nearly 5 years, Fred and I worked side by side. He was far more than a colleague to me. He was a close friend. I will miss him every day.' The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami by his housekeeper where he lived alone. She called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. The New York Post also wrote a column last month comparing the real-life doctor to the fictional doctor on Tina Fey's hit comedy. 'Sources: Dr Fredric Brandt was "devastated" over comparisons to the protagonist on Tina Fey’s new Netflix show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt",' Abravanel tweeted. Behar tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed' An eye for art: Dr Brandt, a cosmetic dermatologist and well-known art collector pictured in front of a piece from his collection at his apartment in New York City on March 7, 2014 . Dr Franff only appears in one episode, titled 'Kimmy Goes To The Doctor!', of the first season. The character shares Dr Brandt’s smooth skin, platinum blond hair and enthusiasm for plastic surgery, but his door sign claims he’s a ‘board certified D, DS, DDSOBGYN’, rather than a cosmetic dermatologist. The Dr Franff character is depicted on the Netflix show with a high-pitched laugh and unable to speak certain words due to his plastic surgery. He is also seen drinking  from a surgical bag and reinflates his own face after being punched. Netflix had no comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy.

Moscow (CNN)A Russian TV channel aired Hillary Clinton's first campaign video with a rating stamp that means it's for mature audiences, because of fears it might run afoul of the country's anti-gay propaganda law. A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. "There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't," a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. "Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video)." Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, "I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about." The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that "gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights." Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as "a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia." Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. "I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them," Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). "We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone," he said before the 2014 Games.

A Pennsylvania couple have been killed after their 1923 Model T Ford convertible skidded off the roadway and flipped over. Ralph Cramer, 70, and his wife, Lynn, 59, were returning home from the Creekside Café in Mount Joy at about 9 p.m. on Sunday when the accident occurred. First responders arrived to find that the couple had died from multiple traumatic injuries suffered in the crash. Ralph Cramer, 70, and his wife, Lynn, 59, were returning home from the Creekside Café in Mount Joy at about 9 p.m. on Sunday when the accident occurred . Manheim Borough Police Chief Joseph Stauffer told Lancaster Online that the vehicle left the road, flipped over and landed upside-down in a ditch. It was not immediately known who was driving or if the couple had worn seat belts. The top was down when the wreck occurred. Stauffer says there's evidence the vehicle started to skid at a slight left turn, then went off the road and hit an embankment near a barn. The vehicle had been rebuilt or restored, with new elements. 'There are no indicators of what caused the accident yet,' said Stauffer. The investigation continues and Manheim police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

(CNN)A French-language global television network regained control of one of its 11 channels Thursday after a cyberattack a day earlier crippled its broadcasts and social media accounts. Television network TV5Monde was gradually regaining control of its channels and social media outlets after suffering what the network's director called an "extremely powerful cyberattack." In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. On a mobile site, which was still active, the network said it was "hacked by an Islamist group." ISIS logos and markings appeared on  TV5Monde social media accounts. But there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group. As day broke Thursday in Europe, the network had regained the use of one of its 11 channels and its Facebook page, Paul Germain, the chain's editor in chief, told BFMTV, a CNN affiliate in France. However, by late morning, a number of pages on the network's website had messages saying they were under maintenance. The outage began around 8:45 p.m. Paris time (2:45 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. TV5Monde offers round-the-clock entertainment and news programming that reaches 260 million homes worldwide, according to the Ministry of Culture and Communications. It functions under a partnership among the governments of France, Canada and Switzerland, as well as the Wallonia-Brussels Federation. Other networks that provide content to TV5Monde include CNN affiliates France 2 and France 3, France 24 and Radio France International.

A singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner. Captured in a front room in Bahama, North Carolina, the three dogs – a Husky called Sky, a brown and white Springer Spaniel called Sadie and a black and white Springer Spaniel called Marshall – take their positions on their make-shift stage. Getting the tune underway, Sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on Sky’s ear as if whispering something – Sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction. The video begins with Sadie the Springer Spaniel barking and interacting with the Husky named Sky . The Springer Spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the Husky joins it, but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl. Following the Husky’s lead, the Spring Spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another. Meanwhile the other Springer Spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner. No, it's like this! The Husky begins howling, causing the Springer Spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead . All together now! The three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony . Before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl, which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo. The trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder. The howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs – who continue to wag their tails – showing any signs of letting up. No encore? The owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise . Eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying: ‘Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.’ And the three dogs, rather put out about being interrupted, stopping and turning to look at him in surprise.

Former Holland forward Dirk Kuyt is returning to Feyenoord next season, aiming to end his professional playing days at the club that was a launching pad for nine years at Liverpool and Fenerbahce, the Rotterdam club announced Friday. Kuyt signed a one-year contract with Feyenoord, who are currently third in the top-flight Eredivisie, but said his stay will likely be longer. Kuyt grew into a favorite among Feyenoord's fanatical fans during his first stint with the club from 2003-2006, after transferring from Utrecht. He was the Eredivisie's top scorer in the 2004-2005 season and was named Dutch footballer of the year in 2006. Dirk Kuyt (left) is returning to Feyenoord, nine years after leaving the Dutch Eredivsie club for Liverpool . Kuyt retired from international football in October after finishing third with the Netherlands at last year's World Cup - a tournament where he underscored his versatility by playing on the wing and at left back. He made 104 appearances for the Netherlands and scored 24 goals. He also was part of the team that finished second in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, losing to Spain in the final. The 34-year-old said now is a good time to return to Rotterdam as "I'm fit and have a great drive to make a success of my time at De Kuip," Feyenoord's stadium. Feyenoord director Martin van Geel said that although Kuyt signed only a one-year deal both he and the club intend his stay in Rotterdam to be longer. "Dirk can keep going for years," Van Geel said. "As far as he's concerned, he can become the Ryan Giggs of Feyenoord and we will add many more years. This will be music to the ears of all Feyenoord fans." The forward has had a successful career for Liverpool, Fenerbache and playing for his country .

While it might be the nation's largest grocer, Walmart Supercenter was ranked at the bottom of the barrel  in a recent survey of America's supermarkets. The retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in Consumer Reports' annual survey, and this year it was rated number 67, the second worst supermarket. As it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine, Walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce. However, it was noted for its better-than-average prices. Walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in Consumer Reports' annual supermarket survey . The retailer (above a worker in the produce section of a Walmart in Miama) came in at number 67 followed by chain Waldbaum's, which was in last place . 'Every store I go in has room to improve,' said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a statement that the company released to Consumer Reports. 'I can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better. 'And if we nail those, one store at a time, our short-term performance gets better.' The respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness, food quality, freshness and staff courtesy. Walmart was joined by A&P (rated number 66) and Waldbaum's (number 68), which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed, according to CBS. The annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts, which was cited by a quarter of respondents. Other findings included: . Source: Consumer Reports . America's favorite supermarket, taking first place, is New York-based Wegmans. The retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness, baked goods and overall shopping experience. Publix came in second place followed by Trader Joe's, Fareway Stores and Market Basket. Wegmans was also among a total of three grocers, including Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, that earned outstanding produce scores. 'It's going to sound cliché, but our employees are our secret sauce,' Jo Natale, Wegmans' vice president of media relations told Consumer Report. Natale also shed light on the fact that Wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded, which 'allows us to take a long-range view, invest in people, and grow at a controlled rate.' While only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely  satisfied with the quality of their store's produce, meat and poultry offerings; nationwide, Consumer Reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings. Findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including Wegmans, Publix, Costco, Whole Foods and Fresh Market were considered standouts in this category. So as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $5,400 on food, what makes a supermarket the best? The survey noted that those who were the 'freshest' stores were usually the best  overall. Wegmans (file photo above) was rated America's favorite supermarket followed by Publix, Trader Joe's and Fareway Stores . In the past, check out speed and low prices might have satisfied customers, but the survey said they are now also demanding a wider variety of healthy, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. They also want more organics and local produce. 'There's a growing rejection of overly processed and packaged foods, especially among younger consumers,' says Willard Bishop's Jim Hertel.

A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, "Wow!"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.

(CNN)Thinking about presidential candidates?  Apparently, hormones are a major factor one should consider. According to one female businesswoman in Texas, Hillary Clinton shouldn't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she'll start an unnecessary war. When George W. Bush waged an unnecessary war in Iraq -- was his testosterone to blame? As Cheryl Rios, the CEO of Go Ape Marketing, sees it: "We're built differently, we have different hormones. In the world that we live in, I understand that there's equal rights and that's a wonderful thing and I support all of that. I don't support a woman being president." "With the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war," Rios wrote in a Facebook post. If Rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the Oval Office, she'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president. Throughout history, male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders' decision-making. Studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts. If science doesn't convince you, just Google "cheating politicians" for the long and sordid list of men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Sanford and John Edwards, whose hormones got the best of them. Rios has taken a lot of flak for her "biblically" inspired beliefs, but she's not the only one who's arguing that a woman's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern. Time magazine declared Hillary Clinton the "perfect" age to be president, because she's a postmenopausal woman who is "biologically primed" to lead. (She also happens to be a former first lady, senator and secretary of state.) I'm not joking. Believe me, I wish I were. No wonder Jon Stewart left "The Daily Show" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing. If discussions about a candidate's hormones are what we have to look forward to, the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed. But underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration: The bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015, a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias. We want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything. And you'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college, graduate school and the work force. But what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability, but a bias in how women and girls are viewed. Unfortunately, Cheryl Rios' view of women is not unique. Some people believe women have "our place" and that place is not at the table. They'll tell your daughter to "go for it" but believe she isn't qualified to fulfill her dreams. In a compelling series about women and work, Wharton School professor Adam Grant and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes. The evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless. It's overt: There are more men on corporate boards named John, Robert, William or James than there are women on boards altogether. The bias is also covert: When students rate their favorite professors, they describe the men as "geniuses" and the women as "nice." The bias is real, yet so many of us are blind to it. Hillary Clinton might not be the perfect candidate, but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the White House a much steeper climb. That's not just a problem for Democrats -- it's a problem for Republicans, Independents, everyone. The fact is, equality benefits everyone. It's better for the bottom line (companies with more women in leadership roles make more money).  It's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier, healthier, and more successful. It's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages.  And it's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results. Our nation, our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men. It's not enough to say to our daughters: "You can be anything you want to be." What we need to say is: "You can be anything you want to be, despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong." Rios said that if Clinton is elected, she is "moving to Canada" because "a female shouldn't be president."  Apparently Rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about Canada: Kim Campbell became the country's first female prime minister in 1993. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Canadians elected their first female prime minister, Kim Campbell.

Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after an evening in which their relegation into Sky Bet League One was marked by pre-match supporters' protests against Karl Oyston. Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation . Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen. 'We got off to a flyer and having got back to 1-1 I'm a little bit disappointed we didn't take anything on a horrible night on a horrible pitch.'

Real Madrid have 48 hours to make a decision on Javier Hernandez as the clock runs down on their first option to buy the Manchester United striker. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Monday that the European champions would take stock of Hernandez's situation at the end of the season. However, under the terms set out by United when they loaned the 26-year-old to Madrid, Thursday April 30 marks the end of the Spanish club's 'exclusivity period' to buy the player. Javier Hernandez is enjoying a fine run of form at Real Madrid - scoring three times in his last two games . Hernandez (centre) returned to training with his Real Madrid team-mates on Tuesday . Hernandez (second left) was all smiles in training, but the 26-year-old faces an uncertain future . From Friday they will no longer have first option and United will field offers of around £10million from West Ham, Southampton and Lazio. The Mexico striker who has scored three goals in his last two games has one year left on contract at Old Trafford, but his latest displays have boosted his valuation. Ancelotti said: 'It is a subject that we will evaluate at the end of the season. What I can say is that I have liked his professionalism during the whole year. He is enjoying his opportunity a lot, he has a high level of professionalism and for a coach to have these type of players that are always ready is very positive.'

(CNN)People magazine has anointed Sandra Bullock the world's most beautiful woman of 2015, the publication revealed on Wednesday. Bullock, 50, joins a long line of actresses to receive the honor, including last year's cover girl, Lupita Nyong'o, and Gwyneth Paltrow in 2013. She seems to be taking it all in stride, calling the whole thing "ridiculous." "Real beauty is quiet. Especially in this town, it's just so hard not to say, 'Oh, I need to look like that,' " she told People. "No, be a good person; be a good mom; do a good job with the lunch; let someone cut in front of you who looks like they're in a bigger hurry. The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying." The cover story focuses on Bullock's home life with her son, Louis, 5, and her efforts to stay healthy and fit past her 40s. "I was putting him to bed and told him that even when I'm old and gray and more wrinkly than I am now, I'll still love him and want to tuck him in," she said. "And he asked why I have wrinkles, and I said, 'Well, I hope some of them are from laughing so much.' And he touched my face and said, 'You're not old, you're just happy.' " The Oscar-winning star of movies including "Gravity," "The Blind Side" and "Crash" said she's happy with who she is. "As long as I'm healthy and strong and I don't let this mind of mine run amok with insecurities about what I am not, I can look in the mirror and like who I see." The selection of Bullock, the oldest woman to receive top honors in the history of the list, is a sign that beauty knows no age, say some. "Great choice! Gorgeous, talented, over 50 and FABULOUS! That's the way it's done!" wrote one fan on People's Facebook page. Also making the "most beautiful" cut this year: Gabrielle Union, Ariana Grande and Laverne Cox. The issue hits newsstands Friday.

Jane Tipper had been walking her dog Molly when the eight-year-old chased a lamb over a cliff . A Border Terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall after chasing a spring lamb off the edge of  a cliff before spending three days stranded on a remote beach. Dog Molly had been on a walk with owner Jane Tipper and her daughter Hannah in Eype, Dorset, last week when the she fell over the cliff's edge along with the lamb. Molly survived a vertical drop of 100ft then rolled 150ft down a steep slope and coming to rest in gorse near the bottom. Her distraught owners managed to see that the eight-year-old had survived the drop, but had no way of getting down to the beach to get her. A team of ten coastguards arrived on the scene and a winchman was lowered down the cliff face but was unable to find her despite four hours of searching. Ms Tipper, who had been celebrating her 64th birthday, was forced to return home in nearby Charmouth without her beloved dog which she has had since she was a puppy. She contacted the website DogLost which arranged for missing posters to be put up in the area. Three days later, Molly was found in an exhaustive state after walking a mile further along the beach to an area popular with dog walkers. It is unclear what had happened, but luckily, she has come through her ordeal relatively unscathed - but there has been no sign of the lamb since the incident. Ms Tipper said: 'I was with my daughter, it was my birthday and we planned a short walk and lunch in a local cafe but we never got there. The border terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall, including a 100ft vertical drop, in Eype, Dorset, but her owner had no way of reaching her. Coastguards searched thoroughly but were unable to find her . 'Molly's usually very good, she doesn't chase animals. 'She fell about 200ft but the cliff was on a slight slope. I couldn't see her at the bottom but my daughter did so we knew she survived the drop. 'The coastguard winched one of them over the cliff and he went from side to side looking for her but couldn't see her. 'It's rocky there, there's thick patches of gorse and it's extremely dangerous. 'After a couple of hours they said they just couldn't spot her. They were very upset about it.' She added the incident left her 'completely numb'. 'We didn't stop searching at the end of the day,' she said. 'When I got home I phoned as many people as I could think of.' But fortunately, a female dog walker recognised Molly from the lost posters that had been put up in the area on Friday. After Ms Tipper put up missing dog posters, Molly was identified by a dog walker three days after going missing. Pictured right, the cliff face in Dorset where Molly fell . Ms Tipper added: 'The lady was walking her dogs when Molly followed her and sat next to her. She called me and we met up and fortunately it was Molly, I was worried it was going to be someone else's dog. 'Molly was very pleased to see me, especially when I got a gravy bone out of my pocket. 'She wasn't hurt or limping or anything, but she was shattered and spent the rest of the day asleep when we got home. 'I think it's really knocked the stuffing out of her. ' A coastguard spokesman urged dog owners to always keep their pets on lead while walking near the coast.

(CNN)Sawyer Sweeten grew up before the eyes of millions as a child star on the endearing family sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond." Early Thursday he committed suicide, his sister Madylin Sweeten said in a statement. He was 19. "This morning a terrible family tragedy has occurred," Madylin Sweeten said in a statement passed on by her manager Dino May. "We are devastated to report that our beloved brother, son, and friend, Sawyer Sweeten, took his own life. He was weeks away from his 20th birthday.  At this sensitive time, our family requests privacy and we beg of you to reach out to the ones you love." Sweeten, best known for his role Geoffrey Barone, was visiting family in Texas, entertainment industry magazine Hollywood Reporter reported, where he is believed to have shot himself on the front porch. Sawyer Sweeten was born in May 1995 in Brownwood, Texas. He was a year and a half old when he started on "Raymond," playing next to his real-life twin brother Sullivan, who starred as Michael Barone, according to the website IMDb. Their sister, Madylin, played their TV sister Ally Barone. The show was about the adults, and the children, especially the twins, had bit parts, adorable cameo moments. In the beginning, they were too young to speak. The series developed a loyal following and ran from September 1996 through May 2005. According to his IMDb profile, Sawyer did not appear to take on acting roles after "Raymond" was discontinued. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.

A video showing a man cracking a giant egg to reveal another fully formed egg inside, may be enough to scramble your brain. YouTube user Elman511 cracked open the over-sized egg that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ While the instance is extremely rare, it’s caused when the hen is in the process of forming an egg in her oviduct and another oocyte – the ovum or egg cell that becomes the yolk of the egg – is released too soon. Scroll down for video . Egg-traordinary: US YouTube user Elman511 cracked open an over-sized egg (shown on the left) that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ In the video, Elman511 cracks the egg, which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. He then cracks the smaller egg, which also has a yolk and white inside. ‘That’s the end of the nesting dolls of egg…an egg inside of an egg… crazy man,’ he said, before noting that the yolks look rich. Egg-citing: In the video, ‘Elman511’ cracks the egg (pictured), which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. The unusual occurrence is down to a counter-peristalsis contraction . This is when a second oocyte (yolk) is released by the hen's ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The unusual occurrence is called a counter-peristalsis contraction. A hen releases an oocyte from her left ovary into her oviduct every 18 to 26 hours, Back Yard Poultry Mag explained. Usually, the oocyte travels down the oviduct, adding layers of the egg until it’s laid through the hen’s vent. But in a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The phenomenon has been mentioned as far back as 1250 AD by the Dominican friar and polymath Albertus Magnus in his book De Animalibus. Ask the egg-spert: In a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. This results in an egg with another made inside it, producing two yolks (pictured)

(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for "lost" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the "holiday" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the "mistake" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the "war on women" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious "war on women" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The "war on women" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the "war on women" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative "solution" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.

Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge . A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman . 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'

It was picked up by a privately-owned security camera . According to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray . The news comes hours after Baltimore Police admitted the van transporting Gray made a previously unreported stop. The mysterious detail was picked up by a privately-owned security camera, and will be integral to the police investigation into Gray's death, which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on Thursday morning. It is not known why the van stopped at the corner of North Fremont Ave and Mosher Street before it made another two stops then finally transported Gray to the hospital. And police have yet to clarify why Gray would have been standing without a seat belt on. Just nine days before his arrest, the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy, making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van. Revelation: Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop. He refused to elaborate on the details of the new information . Police Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to elaborate on the new information. He said the contents of the report, which was completed and handed to the State Attorney at 8.50am Thursday, will remain confidential as they continue to investigate. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested. The report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver, who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators, according to ABC. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton. As the police department, Mayor's office, and state prosecutors refuse to address the development, it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of Gray's arrest more than two weeks ago. A relative of one of the suspended police officers told CNN she believes Gray was injured during his arrest outside the van. Her family member, she said, was based inside the van, and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he 'didn't do'. However, this theory is at odds with the medical examiner's report which allegedly found Gray sustained injuries by falling over inside the van, where he had been placed without a seat belt. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN her family member was in the van with Gray as he screamed and cried for medical help. But she believes the spinal injury which led to Gray's death was inflicted earlier, during his arrest on April 12. In an appeal that echoes Gray's family, she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow. 'Six officers did not injure this man,' she told Don Lemon. Secret stop: This is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stop . These are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stop . Jung Hwang's convenience store's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting Freddie Gray . 'Six officers didn't put him in the hospital. 'I'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did, that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.' Her words came after a police document was leaked to the Washington Post, in which the other prisoner in the transport van with Gray said he could hear the 25-year-old slamming himself against the wall. The prisoner speculated that Gray was trying to hurt himself. In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'. However, he admits he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton . The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family. 'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we've seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' Outrage over the unexplained death of a black man in Baltimore, Maryland prompted nationwide protests against police brutality on Wednesday from Houston to Boston. Baltimore has been the scene of near-nightly protests ever since the April 19 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who is believed to have been fatally injured while in police custody. State Attorney Marilyn Mosby urged the public to be patient as she reviews the information. 'While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,' Mosby said on Thursday. 'We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.' Freddie Gray: The 25-year-old was poisoned by lead paint as a child growing up in Baltimore . Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west side . Nicknamed 'Pepper', he was described by an ex-girlfriend as happy-go-lucky with an infectious sense of humor. The Baltimore police knew him, however, as a 5ft-8ins felon who had notched up at least 18 arrests and a handful of convictions - mainly for Class A drugs but also burglary, assault and illegal gambling. He was said to have set off running at the sight of police patrolling a well known open-air drug market. He was taken into custody for possession of a switchblade and during transport to the station he experienced what officers described as 'a medical emergency'. Gray, who had asthma, requested an inhaler and had trouble breathing in the van, but police didn't provide his inhaler. According to Gray's family his spine was severed 80 per cent at his neck, three vertebrae were fractured and his larynx was injured. Court papers describe Gray's childhood as problematic. He lived with his heroin-addicted disabled mother in a home in Sandtown-Winchester that contained enough poisonous lead in the peeling painted walls and windowsills for a court settlement to conclude that he and his two sisters were incapable of leading normal functioning lives. Lab tests conducted in the 1990s showed that they had levels of lead in their blood nearly double what the state of Maryland defines as the minimum for lead poisoning. In Baltimore, more than 2,600 children have been found to have high levels of lead in their blood, according an annual report released by the Maryland Department of the Environment in 2014. 'This is the toxic legacy of lead-based paint,” Ruth Ann Norton, head of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative and a founding member of the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission, told the Baltimore Sun. 'Our kids are ill equipped to stay in the classroom, finish school. They’re very unlikely to go on to higher education. They’re less likely to be able to hold a job', she said. 'They’re less equipped to be able to overcome the poverty and other circumstances that pull them down. Children with lead poisoning will have defects, regardless of whether their parents are ‘nice’ or not.' Gray lived off the resulting 'lead check' settlement although it is unclear exactly how much he received. Whatever money he did have he was said to spend buying designer accessories. The Sandtown neighborhood is a 72-block neighborhood made up of almost entirely of African Americans. More than one-third of residents live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter are unemployed. The majority of Maryland's state prison population are said to said to hail from Sandtown, according to the Justice Policy Institute.

A man was arrested in Quebec on Monday after he was filmed allegedly threatening a mother, her husband, and their two children with a chainsaw in a fit of road rage. Manuel Delisle, the man accused of the road rage incident involving a chainsaw, has pleaded not guilty to armed assault on Tuesday. Karine Cyr recorded the confrontation on Sunday as she was vacationing with her husband Alexandre Hermenier and their two children. Scroll down for video . Terrifying moment: Manuel Delisle (pictured) allegedly threatened a family with a chainsaw in a fit of road rage after the family attempted to follow him to record his license plate because he cut them off . After the video was posted at 7pm on Sunday night to Facebook it has been shared over 30,000 times and has over 1 million views. Delisle was arrested on Monday following the release of the viral video. Children can be heard screaming and crying in the background of the chilling footage. 'In the heat of the moment, I kept filming.... As a mother, I got very angry. I said, "Before threatening my children, come and see me,"' Cyr told CBC Montreal. The man eventually went back to his car, says Cyr, after noticing that he was being filmed and that Cyr was calling police. 'I think the man noticed that, first of all, I caught it all on video, and he could see on my face that I was terrorized and he saw me call the police,' said Cyr. Scared family: Karine Cyr (center) recorded the confrontation on Sunday as she was vacationing with her husband Alexandre Hermenier (left) and their two children . Cyr said that when the incident occured, her husband Hermenier was driving the car and that her two children were in the back seat. Cyr said that Delisle was driving recklessly and cut them off so her husband Hermenier followed the driver to record his license plate number. The two cars ended up in a dead end road and that's when Hermenier parked his car so that the other car could not leave. Hermenier said that's when Delisle allegedly threatened them with a loud piece of machinery. 'It was a terrifying situation,' Hermenier said. Cyr says that in the future if she sees a driver being reckless, she will not follow him, especially if she is with her children. 'Everyone will react differently, but I would like to say that if you see dangerous driving, do not follow the driver — the mistake that we made with two children in the back seat. We regret it tremendously. If it happens to you, pull over and just call police.' Delisle is scheduled to return to court July 7. He was released for the time being and ordered to stay away from the couple’s home and workplace and told not to communicate with them. Conditional release: Delisle released for the time being and ordered to stay away from the couple’s home and workplace and not communicate with them until he returns to court on July 7 .

Screeching around the track in a car he last drove more than 50 years ago, Sir Stirling Moss appears to have lost none of his racing pedigree. And at 85, the man widely seen as history's greatest all-round racer has revealed the unusual daily routine he thanks for his impressive longevity – 77 press-ups and half a bottle of Chardonnay. Sir Stirling, who won 212 races in his 14-year career, also spoke about how he has swapped the high-octane vehicles of his heyday for a tiny electric car that has a top speed of just 50mph. Reunited: Sir Stirling Moss sitting behind the wheel of the refurbished Austin-Healey Sprite . Success: The 85-year-old won 212 races during his 14-year career before a crash at Goodwood in 1962 . Back in action: Sir Stirling examines the refurbished car alongside Car SOS presenter Fuzz Townshend . Speaking to The Daily Mail, Sir Stirling said he sees fitness as a 'way of life' which is why he is still so confident behind the wheel. However, never one for strenuous gym sessions, he puts his health down to more unusual methods. He said: 'I have half a bottle of wine a day, which fits in very nicely, and that's it. I do what I call lady press ups and I do 77 a day. 'It's not as difficult as it sounds because I do them from a kneeling position. I could not do 70 press ups like I could when I was 30 years old. 'I've broken various bones during my career so I'm not that flexible. I think staying fit is a way of life more than anything else really.' When it comes to diet, he said he believes in indulgence and never denies himself something he wants. He said: 'I never go to bed hungry, let's put it that way, especially as Susie is such a fantastic cook. Car SOS sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. Above, Sir Stirling with presenters Fuzz Townshend and Tim Shaw . Sir Stirling drove the refurbished car in 1962 - one month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career (pictured above). He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks . 'I allow myself whatever I want but I would have to say my indulgences are that Susie and I drink one bottle of wine each day, white certainly, Chardonnay. And chocolate. I'm trying to cut that down but not that successfully.' He made the revelations after a new documentary reunited the father-of-two with the Austin-Healey Sprite he used as a training car before the 1962 Sebring three-hour race. The race took place a month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career. He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks. He returned to the cockpit a year later but decided against competing professionally as he felt he was no longer driving instinctively. The Austin-Healey Sprite was also used by the rest of his team, including Hollywood star Steve McQueen and racing legends Innes Ireland and Pedro Rodriguez. Car SOS, which broadcasts on the National Geographic Channel on Thursday, sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. While he found fame hurtling around corners at death-defying speeds, Sir Stirling now takes a more measured approach to the road. For the last 18 months he has been driving a Renault Twizy, an electric car with a top speed of 50mph. He said of the car, which retails for less than £7,000: 'I live right in the middle of London, right by Hyde Park Corner, and the limitations on an electric car like that, you don't notice them. 'If I lived outside the North Circular there might be times when I'd think "Crickey, I wonder if I'll make it back on the charge" but having said that, the Twizy is just the sort of car to have around London. Sir Stirling has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. Above, the couple at Silverstone in July 2011 . 'It is absolutely very different to the cars I used to drive. There are certainly good reasons to have a petrol car but living where I do, in the centre of London, I can't think of anything better than what I have got.' Sir Stirling, who was knighted in 2000, said he would not want to be a professional driver today because he thinks there are too few races. He said: 'It's quite different now though, they only do 18 races a year, I was doing 52 because I would go down to Australasia in the winter or Malaysia or South Africa and do all types of racing. ' It's so different now that you can't compare the life of a driver then and now. It's unfortunately one of those things that has moved on and I don't think will ever be able to move back.' He has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. He added: 'If your wife is your best friend that's the important thing to me. If every decision you think about or make or take you discuss with her first, I think that's very important. 'But then Susie says I do what I want anyway.' Car S.O.S. broadcasts on Thursday April 9 at 8pm on National Geographic Channel.

The police officer accused of murdering Walter Scott will be banned from seeing his first-born child for several months, it was revealed today. Patrol officer Michael Slager will be refused the right to hold the baby which his wife Jamie is set to give birth to in a few weeks. He is only granted video access to his eight and a half month's pregnant wife and an officer stands outside the booth whenever he talks to his family. They are not allowed to spend any time together and contact is via video screens with headphones at the Charleston County jail. But the baby will not be able to enter the South Carolina prison. Before the fall: Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, with his wife Jamie before his arrest. Slager was charged with murder after shooting Walter Scott, 50, after stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina . Visit: Michael Slager received a visit at Charleston County Jail last Friday from his pregnant wife and mom . It is deemed unsafe for an infant to enter the prison so Slager will have to rely on photographs as cell phones and access to the internet is forbidden. He will be informed by a telephone call and have to wait to see photographs, which will be examined by officials before being presented to him. When Jamie attended the jail on Friday, she was made to turn through the prison's reception area and take a seat next to a video screen for a talk with him which lasted around two hours. The booths are protected by screens to prevent onlookers from seeing inmates, but appointments have to made in advance. Relatives of other prisoners queued to use the video booths after registering with prison officials behind thick glass security screens as Jamie and her accused husband talked with the aid of headphones. But their first child together will not be allowed to visit him in prison until jail chiefs decide that the baby's health would not be at risk from being there. Although there is no specific age limit, prison policy is not to allow babies in. No date has yet been set for his first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away. Major Eric Watson of the Charleston County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online: 'He is treated just like any other prisoner, except for being in protective custody. 'His baby won't be coming to the prison and he will not be allowed to see the child. It could be several months before he does. 'His attorney can apply for the baby to be brought to the jail if he wants.' Walter Scott was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen. Family tell says the light was an accessory and both mandatory stop lamps were functioning . Slager, 33, already has two step children from his wife's previous marriage, but the new baby will be the first for him and Jamie. Major Watson said Slager had no access to the internet and was under close scrutiny to deter any threat from angry prisoners over the shooting of Walter,who was gunned down by the officer after being stopped for an apparent faulty tail light on his Mercedes. Walter's supporters and family say he was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen and this was wrong because the light was an accessory and both his obligatory stop lamps were functioning. Major Watson said Slager was being offered three meals a day and recreation time, but was isolated from other inmates. Housed in a room with one small window, he has no interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail. One released prisoner said outside the gates: 'Man, it ain't no holiday being in there. He has to watch his back more than most because of what he did. There's a lot of angry men in there, black and white.' Walter's brother Anthony said police faced 'many questions' about traffic stops based on racial profiling and that his brother's death should serve as a catalyst for a change in police policies. Meanwhile, the man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton. No date has yet been set for Slager's first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away . The mystery man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton . The 30-year-old was detained by police as Walter fled his Mercedes Benz before dying in a hail of bullets and later released. Pierre's family said they had no idea why he was in the car and how he came to be friends with the shooting victim. His grand mother Eunice Fulton, 70, said: 'I spoke with my daughter Franetta on Thursday and Pierre had only just told her he was in the car. 'It was a terrible incident but we haven't had the chance to speak to him about it. He used to live with me until a couple of years ago. But I don't where he hangs out now. He moves around.' Pierre, who was known to police, had stayed in the background since Walter was shot by officer Michael Slager and at the weekend rejected media requests for interviews. He has given a full statement to investigators, but police refused to reveal his name and what he has told them. He had requested privacy. Pierre was caught on the policeman's dash cam after Walter had fled and been shot. But police released him without charge and he was not suspected of any crime. He has convictions for unlawfully carrying a pistol and served 174 days in prison in 2005 and has been arrested several times. His grandmother added: 'He is a good grandson. He cares for his family. But I don't know what he is doing now.' Pierre has worked as a cleaner, laundry man and warehouseman over the years, but some members of his family have lost touch with him. Rosanne Grant of Alternative Staffing employment agency told Daily Mail Online: ' He worked at various jobs over the period of a year through me. The last time I hear about him was in 2006 and nothing since. I don't know what he has been working at.'

The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was ‘no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident’. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had ‘existed for some time prior to the accident’. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell’s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.’

Sunderland are trailing former Wigan striker Franco di Santo. The Argentine is playing for Werder Bremen and has scored 13 goals in 22 games this season. The Bundesliga side want £8million for the 26-year-old who Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton knows well from his time at Chelsea. Sunderland are considering a summer move for in-form Werder Bremen forward Franco Di Santo . The Argentine has been in superb form for his club this season, netting 13 goals in 22 games . Di Santo began his senior career with Chilean side Audax Italiano in 2006, before catching the Blues' eye two years later. However, he failed to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and following a similarly ineffectual loan spell at Blackburn Rovers, was sold to Wigan in 2010. He spent three seasons with the Lancashire-based outfit, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances. Di Santo was an unused substitute during the club's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2013, before being released at the end of that season. He made the move to the Bundesliga in August 2013 and has appeared to fulfil some of his early promise. Di Santo previously played for Chelsea but struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and was sold . Di Santo played for Wigan for three seasons, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances before being released .

(CNN)Roseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: "My vision is closing in now," she said. "I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up." Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making . Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) "It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of," explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. "Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision," Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy . Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk . Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . Eat your greens . Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries . Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke . While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.

Eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements, a study has claimed. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.

Jessica Silva has spoken about why she had to kill her abusive husband and revealed she hopes his family can one day forgive her for what she did. In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' On Sunday night, Jessica Silva speaks publicly for the first time about the day, Mother’s Day 2012, when she stabbed and killed her partner, the father of her young son. Last month she walked free from court, despite being convicted of manslaughter, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all. Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica’s parents). He revealed to Michael Usher that the ordeal had so destroyed Jessica that 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I didn't recognise her' Jessica Silva admits she was living in fear and violence and she told no one. 'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' 'During the interview she gets to the point where she reveals "my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness". 'I don't know if there will ever be a neat ending. 'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, "you're fat, you're ugly", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . 'On that fateful night, Jessica made a split-second decision to save herself and her family,' according to the 60 Minutes program. 'Jessica opens up about her life with Polkinghorne and recounts what happened the night that ended in his death.' 'I didn't realise that she was going to be as raw as she still was,' Usher added. 'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how "I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.' See the full story on 60 Minutes at 8.30pm on Nine tonight .

(CNN)A 32-year-old Massachusetts man is facing murder charges, authorities said Wednesday, four days after another man's remains were found in a duffel bag. The Middlesex District Attorney's Office said that Carlos Colina, 32, will be arraigned the morning of April 14 for murder in connection with the remains discovered Saturday in Cambridge. Earlier this week, Colina was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. A Middlesex County judge then revoked bail for Colina in another case he's involved in, for alleged assault and battery. The victim in that case is different from the one whose remains were found in recent days. Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. "This was a gruesome discovery," District Attorney Marian Ryan said. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.

Fired: Major General James Post III was fired on Friday after making a treason comment . An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane. A-10 retirement: The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the A-10,  low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support . The inspector general's investigation interviewed several witnesses who remembered Post using the word 'treason' to describe efforts to oppose the Air Force leadership's decision to retire the plane, either via a social media campaign or by talking to Congress. In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.' General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander. Post issued an apology on Friday and said he did not intend to try to prevent people from talking to lawmakers. Handed in a latter: General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander .

Ukip candidate Kim Rose (pictured handing out sausage rolls today) is being investigated by police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls . A Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event, which also saw veteran snooker player White play pool with local youngsters. Mr Rose, a jeweller, said he was oblivious until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. Laughing off the allegations, he said: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes. 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties. 'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 'He said, "it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.' Mr Rose, who will now have to report to a police station on Monday, added: 'It was a fantastic day. We laid on teas, coffees, sandwiches and some sausage rolls. 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.' Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right) branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll' Today Mr Rose was seen out in Southampton handing out sausage rolls to members of the public . He said: 'The Ukip support is very strong here and I feel the main political parties will do anything they can to scrutinise everything about us.' Mr Rose added that if other politicians fear voters could be 'bribed with sausage rolls', perhaps it is not surprising they will not trust the country with a referendum on EU membership. Today the parliamentary candidate was out campaigning on the streets of Southampton, handing out sausage rolls to members of the public. Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, backing Mr Rose. He said: 'I think it’s utter nonsense. There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions. 'Having a few sausage rolls I don’t really think counts as one of those.' Mr Rose said the event, which was attended by 250 people, took place at a community centre in Southampton on February 21 - more than a month before Parliament was officially dissolved. He invited veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, who he described as a long-time friend. The former world number two and six-time World Champion, nicknamed 'The Whirlwind', played pool with residents, who were charged £2 to attend the event. 'I've known Jimmy as a friend for a number of years and so I asked him to come down and play pool with the kids,' Mr Rose said. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. 'I didn't want to make the event very Ukip so we put all the party banners away and everybody had a game of pool with Jimmy.' The Electoral Commission said the pastry provision was a police matter. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We have a received an allegation of "treating" by a prospective parliamentary candidate, contrary to the Representation of the People Act 1983. We are looking into the complaint. No arrests have been made.' Electoral Commission rules on treating state: 'A person is guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting. 'Treating requires a corrupt intent - it does not apply to ordinary hospitality.' Anyone found guilty of treating can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. Mr Rose has been a member of Ukip since 1999. He briefly stood as an independent in the key marginal Southampton Itchen seat in 2010 before pulling out. He is campaigning on tackling deprivation in Southampton, as well as wanting to pull the UK out of the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron came under criticism in the constituency earlier this week after sending a letter to residents spelling the constituency's name wrong three times. His letter, which has his letterhead and signature, had 'Itchen' spelled as 'Itchin', prompting the Conservatives to apologise for the embarrassing mistake. The constituency's MP has been Labour's John Denham since 1992. He held the seat in 2010 by just 192 votes and is standing down after May 7.

Ms Moric told her fans that she was 'shocked' by the suicide claims. She added: 'Luckily I'm fine now nothing serious I need only a bit of rest. But now I made a fine breakfast. Italian media claimed Ms Moric had tried to take her own life in 2009 after taking an overdose. The Croatian-born model, pictured, claimed she collapsed at home due to 'low blood pressure' Italian media claimed Ms Moric, pictured, was found in her apartment by her mother on Saturday night . Ms Moric, pictured, reassured her many fans she only needed some time to recover from her fall . She was once married to famous paparazzi snapper Fabrizio Corona, 41, who ended up in jail and the pair have a son together, Carlos Maria, who was born in 2002. Corona, the 'king' of Italy's paparazzi, was jailed for blackmailing celebs with compromising photographs. Corona's scoops helped fuel the celebrity TV culture driven by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's channels and publications. He claimed he never blackmailed celebrities he snapped, merely offering them first option to buy the photos at the rate he would have sold them to publications. But police tapping his phone during an investigation heard him tell his then wife Nina: 'Yes, it's true, I ruin lives, I am a piece of s*** and I don't even feel guilty any more.'

A husband was left so traumatised by his wife's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock, despite his wife already being given a hefty payout. In a case which could have huge financial consequences for the NHS, Julie Ronayne was awarded £160,000 after she was left 'looking like Michelin man' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008. Her husband Edward, who lives with Mrs Ronayne in Netherley, Liverpool, was awarded £9,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife's appearance. Edward Ronayne was given £9,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up 'like Michelin man' after botched surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital (pictured) The severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis, which the woman had contracted during the surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation. The test case, being heard at London's Appeal Court, could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an NHS mishap. Mr Ronayne was awarded the damages from Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust in July 2013. Liverpool County Court heard how he had been a 'secondary victim' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife's new appearance. He had described her 'colloquially as looking like a Michelin man', the court heard. Mr Ronayne also described his wife's first two days in hospital as 'the worst days of my entire life'. He said he had been 'brought up not to complain' but had never fully recovered from the sight. He added that he had been left feeling tearful, overwhelmed, angry and powerless. The judge, who described him as 'an honest and reliable witness', said: 'His symptoms...were pathological and went beyond simply the distress and anger that a man would suffer due to the near terminal illness of his wife.' But in the appeal court today, Charles Cory-Wright QC, who represents the health trust, told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury. He said Mr Ronayne's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims, costing the cash-strapped NHS millions in compensation. The barrister argued that Mr Ronayne would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation. He added that he was visiting his wife in hospital and therefore would have expected her to look unwell. He told the court: 'Hospitals on a day-to-day basis deal with people who are ill or vulnerable. They go there followed by their loved ones. It is unfortunately a matter of day-to-day occurrence that great emotional responses will take place in a hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if Mr Ronayne is allowed to keep the money. The test case is being heard at the appeal court . 'The question arises more and more often in cases like this as to whether those relatives have a claim.' Stressing the importance of the appeal, he told the judges: 'This appeal is not just about this case, but the concerns NHS Trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place. Peritonitis is caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the stomach. It is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, which can rapidly spread around the body. Peritonitis requires immediate treatment and is a medical emergency. Most cases of peritonitis are the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix or digestive disorders. Peritonitis can be fatal and needs to be treated quickly to avoid such complications. Source: NHS . 'The effect of this judgement, if it stands, is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases, as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock. 'Often emotional illness follows, but there is not the necessary element of shock. There needs to be a suddenly shocking event which, because of its shocking nature, causes that psychiatric illness. That is often lost in the wash in these cases.' But Lord Justice Sullivan said the incident had no doubt been 'shocking' 'Simply going into hospital and seeing one's loved ones and family looking peaky is not enough,' he said. 'But to see one's wife looking like the Michelin man is shocking.' Mr Cory-Wright then replied: 'If you saw your loved one looking like the Michelin man, swollen and all that, it would be shocking in an ordinary sense. 'But it would not be shocking in the sense of being suddenly overwhelmed so as to lead to psychiatric injury.' The judges recognised the importance of the case by reserving their decision on the trust's appeal until a later date. The case was heard in front of Lord Justice Sullivan, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Beatson. Mrs Ronayne went on to make a good recovery.

John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United with thousands of supporters planning to boycott Sunday's home match against Spurs. The 50-year-old has found himself the target of angry fans who are disillusioned with Mike Ashley’s running of the club. Results on the pitch – they have lost five on the spin - have not helped Carver’s cause, but the problems at Newcastle run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad. John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United . United’s supporters will protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from billionaire Ashley, especially as the Magpies have returned record profits of £18.7million and this week revealed they also have £34m sat in a bank account. Carver is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer – or deflect – questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis, distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul. But as reported by Sportsmail last month, senior sources within St James’ Park have indicated that Derby boss Steve McClaren will take over in the summer, regardless of whether or not the Rams are promoted from the Championship. On Tyneside, however, he will inherit what Carver believes is the toughest task in the land: ‘I think it is the hardest job in football, definitely,’ he said. Steve McClaren has already been tipped as a replacement for Carver should he face the Newcastle axe . ‘For me, this is the dream job, but you love it and hate it at the same time. ‘The hardest thing is taking the criticism off your own people. Some of it is deserved and some of it is not. ‘Sometimes you’re dealt the hand and you’ve got to get on with it and this is the hand I’ve been dealt. ‘When I took it on, if I hadn’t accepted then I would have been kicking myself. ‘And I’ve said this before, I genuinely believe that if I’ve got the right tools I can do the job. ‘But it is bitter sweet at the moment. This job is definitely a rollercoaster.’ Website AshleyOut.com are co-ordinating Sunday's planned boycott. They will protest outside of the Gallowgate End before kick-off and after the game. During the match they will go to Leazes Park behind the stadium. Carver, though, has urged fans to get behind the team. Fans are unhappy at how Newcastle are being run under Mike Ashley and have planned a boycott . ‘I would go to the match because I support the team,’ said Carver when asked if he would stay away as a supporter. ‘I think they (boycotters) do support the team but they have obviously got their own issues. I respect those issues. ‘I never thought I'd see this to be perfectly honest, especially in the North East of England because we love football. ‘So obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come, and I respect that.’ Carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against Tottenham Hotspur .

This is the moment when a not-so-little baby elephant seal emerged from the sea to give a surprised tourist one big cuddle. Charlene Fritz, 35, was visiting  Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula as part of an expedition when she made an unusual friend on the beach. Despite being no more than two months old, the elephant seal pup is still thought to have weighed around 200lbs, and Ms Fritz had a struggle sitting upright. Scroll down for video . One big cuddle: The elephant seal is thought to have been no more than two months old, but at a whopping 200lbs, Canadian tourist Charlene Fritz still struggled to reciprocate the hug . Making friends: Ms Fritz had the surprise of a lifetime when the baby elephant seal came out of the water for a cuddle during an expedition to Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula . Will you be my mummy? Elephant seal pups are abandoned by their mothers at just one month to learn how to take care of themselves . Charlene, from Saskatchewan, Canada, said: 'The seal climbed on top of me without hesitation. We shared a very sweet moment in time I will never forget. 'Her mouth was all pink inside and her eyes were amazing to look into. Like the deepest depths of the sea. I could have stared into her eyes forever.' She added: 'It was made very clear to me that I was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her. 'She came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up. I wanted to hug her so badly. 'Physically she felt like a big dough ball, super warm and like she had no bones. She did not smell of fish or have bad breath. She had never even eaten a fish at that point in her life. Rules: Ms Fritz explains that she badly wanted to hug the baby seal, but that regulations on the Antarctic expedition dictated that she in no way touch the pup . 'Sweet moment in time': Ms Fritz described the seal pup's eyes as being 'like the deepest depths of the sea' Crushing: Ms Fritz struggles to sit upright under the weight of the 200lbs baby elephant seal . Two young elephant selas have a rest on the shore of Snow Hill Island, Antarctic Peninsula . Charlene, whose 2011 encounter with the seal was filmed by a friend, had at first wondered why the seal was so friendly but later learned about the harsh weaning process. She said: 'Basically the mother fattens them up with her milk for a month or so, then abandons them on the beach. 'They have never been in the ocean to learn to fish or anything and basically lay there starving until they figure out to take the leap of faith and go into the sea. 'This is why they can be so sweet and looking for love, I guess.' However, an encounter with a full-grown elephant would have been a different prospect. Males of the species can weigh up to two tonnes and are known to have a nasty temper during mating season as the battle to control harems of females.

(CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are "conscientious objectors," and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new "no jab, no pay" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. "The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments," said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. "It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing," Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.

Many people might think that trust issues, long distances and cheating scandals are the biggest strains on a relationship. But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.

James Bond would have lasted just seven minutes into his last movie Skyfall before succumbing to fatal wounds from a uranium shot if the secret agent played by Daniel Craig was real. A group of medical experts watched the 23rd outing for Ian Fleming's hero and concluded that Bond would have been unlikely to survive to the end of the two hour film, and would have died or been critically injured several times . Within the first seven minutes, Bond is hit by a depleted uranium shell - an armour-piercing round normally used to destroy tanks that would almost certainly have killed the hero. Scroll down for video . James Bond would have died minutes into Skyfall - after being hit by a depleted uranium shell and then falling from a speeding train, where he could easily have severed his spine . As Bond fights in an icy loch he would have been likely to have died from the cold or lack of oxygen . In a feature for Total Film, the medical experts examine several different action movies to see whether the man characters would have survived their ordeal. Other movies to undergo the medical assessment were Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis. Unsurprisingly John McClane would not have survived. According to the experts, Bond's depleted uranium wound would have been fatal as it 'would have turned his lungs inside out and killed him'. In the unlikely event the massive round did not cause catastrophic injuries, the radioactive nature of the ammunition 'would greatly increase his cancer risk'. Bond cheats death throughout the two hour film, including when he is locked in a gunfight on the streets of Istanbul as he attempts to chase villain Patrice for a hard drive containing details of undercover agents . The hero effortlessly performs surgery on himself, but would have been likely to have lost too much blood . Not that growing old gracefully was ever likely for James Bond, who at one stage performs surgery on himself to remove a bullet, where he 'risks blood loss, lack of consciousness, nerve and muscle damage'. He also faces a significant risk of infection. Even jumping from the roof of a speeding train into a river presents its own risks, which probably should not be tried by ordinary members of the public as he would likely 'sever his spinal cord or break his neck'. 7 mins - Bond is shot in the chest by a depleted uranium bullet, likely to kill. If he had survived this the radioactive qualities of the ammunition would have increased his risk of cancer. 12 mins - The action hero is shot and then jumps from the roof of a speeding train into a river. The height of this fall would be likely to break his neck. 31 mins - After being shot Bond bravely removes a bullet from his shoulder. This DIY surgery would have led to significant blood loss as well as damaged his nerves and muscles. 2hrs - Bond fights in an icy loch. While the temperature alone would have presented problems, fighting underwater would have significantly depleted Bond's oxygen supply and could have caused him to drown. While James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 has survived since 1960, it is unlikely the man himself would have . However, filming the movie can prove slightly dangerous as Daniel Craig has recently required knee surgery after hurting himself while performing a stunt in his final Bond movie Spectre. Even Home Alone would have produced three fatalities. Marv and Harry would have likely died within hours of the movie's end while Kevin would have been killed within the first third of the film after falling from some shelves. However, Tom Hanks in Cast Away could have plausibly survived on a desert island for four years - as long as he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash. Although according to the experts, 76 per cent of the time he would have died in the accident. While Bruce WIllis' character in Die Hard, John McClane, pictured, would not have made it to the fourth movie . Tom Hanks in Castaway could have survived on the island - in the unlikely event he escaped the aircraft .

Need to have a difficult conversation with your other half or your boss? It might be a good idea to take them out to dinner. We get on better with each other over a meal, according to researchers who said it makes everyone from work colleagues to children seem more pleasant. Dutch and Canadian scientists asked nearly 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent at least five minutes talking to someone else. Well digested: Scientists have found people felt happier and more relaxed while eating at home or at work . About a fifth of the 1,000 meetings recorded took place over a meal, the journal Physiology and Behavior reports. On these occasions participants felt happier and more relaxed, whether at home, at work or elsewhere. They felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments and were more likely to make compromises. They also believed that the person they were with was warmer and more likeable. And hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. One possible explanation is that chewing raises levels of the ‘feel-good’ brain chemical serotonin. Food for thought: The study found that people can talk about tricky subjects far easier over a meal . It is also possible that shared meals enhance our inbuilt desire to be accepted and to please others. Marije aan het Rot, of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, said that tricky topics might be best tackled over a meal. Bosses and employees and also parents and children, might all find it easier to get on at the table while dinner may not be the best idea for a first date. Dr Rot said the people in her study knew each other and the effect of a sharing a meal might be different among strangers. Apart from anything else, meals can be lengthy and people meeting for the first time might struggle to come up with enough conversation.

Have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door, been woken by a Facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger? To deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies, one company has designed a range of prototype products. You can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product, funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Scroll down for video . Leeds-based Direct Line is running a competition called #EverydayFix. They asked groups to design products to deal with common problems. These include forgetting to lock the door, which one company hopes to solve with their Forget Me Lock prototype, shown . The products were designed as part of the Direct Line Everyday Fix design makeathon. They asked people to pick their top ten ‘everyday emergencies’ - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives. Groups from London-based design company Makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist. 1. Not being able to sleep (46 per cent*) 2. Losing your keys (37 per cent) 3. Being stuck in traffic when already late (35 per cent) 4. Losing an important paper or document (33 per cent) 5. Nowhere to park (32 per cent) 6. Printer not working when you need to print something (31 per cent) 7. Running out of battery on your phone whilst out (31 per cent) 8. Discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo (30 per cent) 9. Dealing with machine operated customer service (26 per cent) 10. Forgetting your bank card when paying for an item (25 per cent) *How many people thought this was a problem . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called ‘Snooze’, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep. To deal with not remembering if you had locked your door, ONN Studio created the Forget Me Lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door. It fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. This means that even when out or about, you can find out if your door is locked or not. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost. Direct Line is running a competition on Twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about Snooze, Forget Me Lock or Nipper. The Forget Me Lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key. When the key is turned in a lock it swivels green  to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost . The Nipper device (shown) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep.

Whichever tweet has the most retweets, with the #EverydayFix hashtag, by 23 April will go into a Kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development. ‘We’ve seen the great British designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies,’ said Paul Smyth, co-founder of Makerversity. ‘Through the Direct Line Everyday Fix event, we’ve been able to extend our role as "fixers" and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation’s everyday emergencies,’ added John Shaw, head of R&D and Innovation at Direct Line. Of the products that didn’t make the cut, one was a helmet with ‘bone conduction headphones’ that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you. Another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space, which would then alert you when the space was free, if you couldn’t find somewhere to park. And as another solution to your phone running out of battery, one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies. Products that didn't make the final shortlist included the Parking Pin, shown. You could leave this in a parking space, and it will alert you when the space is free, so you can park your car . The Relay app, shown, would let you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies .

'The owner would buy a bag in a particular colour when it came out and then buy it in another colour a month or so later, or buy matching Jimmy Choos. 'There's probably in excess of 50 pairs of shoes, and they are in immaculate condition too, hardly worn. 'Then we've got about 20 lots of designer clothing and the rest is accessories.

'This is never going to come up again. It's a true one-off and a privilege to be asked to hold the auction. 'I think it's quite unusual for things like this to go without a reserve, but because the proceeds are going to charity, everything has to be sold, so will go to the highest bidder on the day. 'It's such a genuine sale, it's not a sale that has been put together, the items are being sold for a reason. And it's a chance for people to get something in immaculate order. 'We're expecting in excess of 100 people on the day. We've got a reasonable-sized premises so we will cope fine with the extra, but we normally only have about 50 people at a sale.' The auction takes place on April 28 and the items will be available to view the day before. Other items for sale include...

A cancer survivor who had to have part of his mouth removed after a tumour stopped him from swallowing has been given a new tongue made out of part of his arm. David Billing, 48, has told how he had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital, during which surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue. Medics then replaced the lost tissue with muscle from Mr Billing's arm. The only drawback is that it still has hairs on it, and he now has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved. David Billing, 48, had to have part of his tongue removed after being diagnosed with mouth cancer, so doctors made him a new one out of skin from his arm - which still has hairs on it . The dramatic story began after Mr Billing, a part-time welder, went to his GP in October 2013 after being unable to swallow. After a second doctor's appointment, he was referred to Royal Derby where specialists discovered an ulcer on the right-hand side of his tongue and confirmed it was cancer after a biopsy. He said: 'Being told I had cancer was mind-blowing and a real low point for me. I had no idea when they found this ulcer in my mouth that this was what it would be.' It was a double-blow for Mr Billing, as he had been made redundant just a week before from his job at digger manufacturer JCB. He said: 'It was all so overwhelming. My life and everything was ticking along nicely and the next thing I knew I'd lost my job and needed to have a major operation.' David had the procedure to remove the lump and rebuild his tongue on November 13, 2013. He said: 'I had to have a stomach tube fitted first and then go through the main procedure. Mr Billing was forced to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital (pictured), with surgeons sawing between two teeth and through his jaw to get to the tumour . 'They had to cut through the jawbone and get my face wide open to get to the ulcer then they had to remove some lymph nodes in my neck too, just to be safe in case the cancer had spread.' David spent nine days in hospital after his operation, returning now only for check-ups and once for the smaller procedure to reshape his tongue. He said: 'Usually, people have to go on chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the operation and, during this, the skin tissue used to rebuild the tongue shrinks in size. 'Because I didn't need either, it meant I later needed this smaller operation to have the bit of skin trimmed. 'My tongue's absolutely fine. I had to have speech therapy after the procedure but it's not had any long term impact on my speech or my eating or drinking.' David continued to use a feeding tube and relied on liquid foods until his first proper meal on Christmas Day 2013. And, in another fortunate turn of events, he was offered his old job a JCB back in March 2014. He added: 'JCB actually took me back having originally laid me off because of a lack of work. Mr Billing, who is now preparing to run the London Marathon to raise money for Cancer Research, says his speech is back to normal - though he does have to go to hospital to have his tongue shaved . 'It was the best feeling in the world when, two weeks after coming through the operation, the consultant told me the cancer was completely removed and I didn't even need radiotherapy or chemotherapy.' Now David is preparing to run the London Marathon and is hoping to raise more than £3,000 for cancer research. He said: 'I was not fit or well at all when I was watching the London Marathon last year but I thought how much I'd love to do it. 'I've never done anything like it before so, when I started feeling better, I decided to start training and now I'm about to take part in this experience of a lifetime. 'If I can get over the finish line, whatever time I do it in, it will be absolutely brilliant.'

The lovers who got the most complaints in New York City for loud sex are a handyman and the girlfriend he pops round for quickies with in the building where he works. The 25-year-old boytoy is the lover, of a Dominican woman in her late 30s, who invites him round for romps around her entire apartment in Brooklyn. The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex. Most complained: The building maintenance worker (left) and his girlfriend (right), who is now four months pregnant, were complained about six times for excessive noise at the Bay Ridge block, official records show . Say it loud: This is the apartment block with six calls made to 311 - New York city's non-emergency number - because of complaints of loud sex . Blue: The woman who was complained about was spoken to by police today. She later left, saying: 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone.' The woman whose moans during sex sparked the highest number of complaints in New York said today: 'I'm not hurting anyone'. The woman, who declined to give her name, walked out of the apartment block wearing striped maxi dres, a white jacket and sunglasses. She looked upset and said she was hurt by all the attention - and revealed she was pregnant. She said: 'I'm four months pregnant. 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'. On the job: The building handyman complained about over noisy sex was at work today - at the apartment block where his girlfriend lives. House of noise: The apartment building is in Bay Ridge, close to New York harbor in Brooklyn . No idea: The building's owner Madelene Behefte told Daily Mail Online she had no idea about the complaints . No respite: The front door of the apartment at the center of six complaints for noisy sex. It failed to stop neighbors from overhearing the couple's antics . DNAInfo reported that New York's 311 helpline, for non-emergency complaints to city authorities, recorded a total of 133 complaints about loud sex between January 1 2014 and February 12 2015. Brooklyn, the borough now associated with trendy hipsters and home to would-be president Hillary Clinton's campaign, had the highest number of complaints, at 42. Brooklyn is the most populous of the city's five boroughs. Queens was next with 37, the Bronx and 31 and Manhattan had 23. Staten Island recorded none. The website reported that on November 14 last year, a 311 operator logged: 'Neighbors are having very loud sex with the windows open that can be heard throughout the whole bldg.' The complainant told the website the woman was 'moaning and screaming "Oh yeah, oh, do it to me".' It was followed by another woman shouting at the couple: 'Shut your f***ing windows you wh**e.' Complaints to 311 are passed to police to investigate if they are available, but officers found no noise disturbance when they attended the Bay Ridge block.

Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless. The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, José Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than £300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for. Pacquiao works up a sweat as he shadow boxes during preparations for his May 2 clash with Mayweather . With his eyes closed and grimacing with effort, Pacquiao ramps up his shadow boxing routine on Monday . On his toes and focused, Pacquiao is looking to defy the odds against fight favourite Floyd Mayweather . Roach kneels in the corner as Pacquiao's team prepare the eight-division champion for a session on the pads . The Filipino works his way around the ring, looking sharp after sharing a joke with Shapiro and Roach . Pacman limbers up ahead of his workout on Monday in the gym just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood . Pacquiao is going through his final preparations ahead of the bout billed as 'The Biggest Fight in History' Confident Pacquiao kicks his feet high during his warm-up ahead of training at Wild Card Boxing . There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight. Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout. 'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'

Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to quit because he was becoming increasing depressed watching cable news . Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to call time on his 17 year reign because he was becoming increasing depressed by American politics and watching cable news. Speaking for the first time since making his shock decision, Stewart said he was looking forward to not having to watch the 'relentless' 24-hour news networks anymore. 'Watching these channels all day is incredibly depressing,' Stewart told The Guardian. 'I live in a constant state of depression. I think of us as turd miners. I put on my helmet, I go and mine turds, hopefully I don't get turd lung disease.' Asked if he'd ever voluntarily watch Fox News, Stewart said, 'Let's say that it's a nuclear winter, and I have been wandering, and there appears to be a flickering light through what appears to be a radioactive cloud and I think that light might be a food source that could help my family. 'I might glance at it for a moment until I realize, that's Fox News, and then I shut it off.' Stewart also confessed that his 'moments of dissatisfaction' with the show had started to become more frequent. 'It's not like I thought [The Daily Show] wasn't working any more, or that I didn't know how to do it. It was more, "Yup, it's working. But I'm not getting the same satisfaction,'" he said. 'These things are cyclical. You have moments of dissatisfaction, and then you come out of it and it's OK. But the cycles become longer and maybe more entrenched, and that's when you realize, "OK, I'm on the back side of it now.'" Scroll down for video . Stewart said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance in 2011 . Even the upcoming 2016 Presidential election campaign couldn't reignite Stewart's passion the way it once did. 'I'd covered an election four times, and it didn't appear that there was going to be anything wildly different about this one,' said Stewart. 'Honestly, it was a combination of the limitations of my brain and a format that is geared towards following an increasingly redundant process, which is our political process. 'I was just thinking, "Are there other ways to skin this cat?' And, beyond that, it would be nice to be home when my little elves get home from school, occasionally." Stewart also said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance. The former secretary of defense appeared on The Daily Show in 2011 for an interview, which the comedian says he messed up. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, left, would be taking over . 'He just went into the general gobbledegook,' said Stewart. "Mnah mnah mnah, well, you have to remember, it was 9/11 mnah mnah." I should have pushed, but he's very adept at deflecting.' Rumsfeld, who was on the show to promote his memoir, Known And Unknown, dodged Stewart's questions about faulty U.S. intelligence leading up to the Iraq War. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, 31, would be taking over. Noah has already had to combat  accusations of anti-Semitism over a series of old tweets. Stewart has voiced his full support for his successor, recently calling the incoming host 'incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart.' The exiting host told The Guardian that one reason for  stepping down early in the presidential election cycle was to give Noah a big story to tackle. Stewart said he felt 'that, for the show, you don't want to leave when the cupboard's bare. So I think it's a better introduction when you have something providing you with assisted fuel, like a presidential campaign.'

An eight-grade girl accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in adult jail while awaiting trial, a judge. A defense petition to return 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek to the juvenile facility where she was initially sent after the body of 54-year-old Cheryl Silvonek was discovered last month was denied by Lehigh County Judge Maria Dantos on Friday. District Attorney Jim Martin had opposed the petition on behalf of the teenager, who is charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy. Her boyfriend, Caleb Barnes, 20, who is from El Paso, Texas, but was stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, is charged with homicide. JamieSilvonek, the eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, it was ruled on Friday . Cheryl Silvonek's body was found with stab wounds in a shallow grave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and her vehicle partially submerged in a pond a few miles from the family home. Jamie Silvonek was sent to the county jail this month after she was charged as an adult and is in the women's housing unit, away from older inmates, county officials said. Authorities said Barnes and the teenager met in October, when she was 13, but she told him she was 17. Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. The teen's mother found out about their relationship in early March and ordered them to end it. A day later, the teen told Barnes in a text message, 'I want her gone,' police said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. The 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. 14-year-old JamieSilvonek allegedly conspired to kill her mother Cheryl Silvonek with her 20-year-old boyfriend 'because she disapproved of their relationship' Barnes confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, and that given the age disparity 'there has to be some type of duress or coercion'. He said his client 'cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom' and she feared for her life and that of her father. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life . Police found the body of Cheryl Silvonek in a shallow grave a few miles from her home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby .

Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed for a year after orchestrating a scam to steal £15,000 of goods from the Asda in Basildon, Essex, where he worked . An Asda manager orchestrated a scam that used the supermarket's own delivery service to steal goods worth more than £15,000 - then managed to land a job at Lidl after he was sacked. Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed after running the scam where stock including alcohol, cigarettes, DVDs, computer games and consoles were taken from the store in Basildon, Essex, where he worked. Southend Crown Court heard how the conspiracy was uncovered, following a period during which Gridley and colleague Jay Reed were under suspicion. Thomas Daniel, prosecuting, told the court that goods, ranging from televisions to baby formula, were delivered to Reed's address and presumably sold on. He said: 'Two anonymous reports were received by Asda, one of which suggested Mr Gridley was involved in selling items believed to have been stolen, such as TVs and baby formula. 'When Mr Gridley was ill for a certain period of time, those deliveries stopped, and when he recovered they started again. 'Another email suggested stolen goods being delivered to the address of Mr Gridley's cousin.' But shockingly, after being sacked from the store, Gridley managed to land a managerial role at Lidl in Romford, Essex. Gridley, who was former home shopping manager of the store, was sentenced to 12 months for his leading role in a conspiracy to steal £15,852.46 worth of goods between November 2013 and April last year. The court heard that Reed and another defendant James Munyard had been pressured into taking part in the scam by Gridley, who was their superior. Stock including alcohol, cigarettes were taken from shelves and delivered to addresses using the supermarket's own home delivery service. File photo . Section leader Reed, 23, and Munyard, 21, both avoided prison, but were given suspended sentences of eight and four months, respectively. Mitchell Cohen, representing Munyard, told the court that his client, whose role was confined to taking items off shelves and putting them in a crate, had attempted to be transferred from the store in order to escape Gridley's control. James Munyard (pictured) avoided jail for his part in the scam . Reed was deemed to have been in a position of trust and responsibility in the criminal enterprise, but Recorder Gerard Pounder said he had a lesser role than Gridley, 26, and Munyard even less so. Despite hearing Gridley, of Tilbury,  financially supported his former partner and their two-year-old child but also his own father and grandparents, Recorder Pounder said he had no choice but to send him to prison. He said: 'You were in a position of supreme trust and you say you started this because of threats made regarding a drug debt of your cousin's, you continued even as those threats faded, and brought other people in, too.' Sentencing Reed to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 200 hours' unpaid work, he said: 'You were in a lesser role than Mr Gridley but you were a section leader and had responsibilities. 'In that respect you were somebody who knew the system and it was to your premises these items were taken - without that and your part in the enterprise, it would not have worked.' Munyard, who Mr Cohen said 'didn't have the spine to stand up to what he was being asked to do,' was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, and 100 hours' unpaid work. A spokesperson for Lidl told MailOnline they are unable to comment until an internal investigation has been conducted.

The 14-time major champion is bidding to win his fifth green jacket, but has been plagued by a succession of injuries and even the chipping yips in recent times. The world will find out which version of Woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48pm. Defending champion Bubba Watson, hoping to win his third Masters title in four years, will tee off at 2.24pm alongside England's former US Open champion Justin Rose and 21-year-old South Korean amateur Gunn Yang, who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the US Amateur last year. Those watching the 2.02pm group on Thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game's most colourful characters go head-to-head. Ian Poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet, but even he might meet his match in American young gun Patrick Reed, who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at Doral last year. He followed that up by shushing the home crowd during a cocksure display at Gleneagles. Three-time Masters champion Phil MIckelson, hitting from behind trees during practice, will play alongside McIlroy in the first two rounds . Ryan Moore, pictured during a practice round at Augusta, will join McIlroy and Mickelson on the course for round one and two . Woods will be accompanied with Wales' Jamie Donaldson and Jimmy Walker of the USA during the first two rounds of the competition . US Open champion Martin Kaymer is in the group behind world No 1 McIlroy, with Brandt Snedeker and Houston Open winner JB Holmes. McIlroy and Mickelson were among the players battling for the US PGA title in near-darkness at Valhalla last year, with Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light. With 98 players in the field, Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45pm (7:45am local time), with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier, the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while Arnold Palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder. England's Danny Willett will begin his Masters debut in the second group at 12:56pm alongside 1987 winner Larry Mize and US amateur public links champion Byron Meth. Woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth Masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round. The American superstar has started just two events in 2015, carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second, but said he was ready to 'compete to win a golf tournament' after 11 holes of practice on Monday. The final group tees off at 1:59pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world, Australia's Jason Day, Spain's Sergio Garcia and Fowler. Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors last year.

A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by £345 to £975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from £870 to £1,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices . The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from £870 to £1,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game . Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay £345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost £975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season . Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.

A pregnant mother with a rare form of dwarfism has revealed the physical challenges of raising her three-year-old son - who is more than half her size - while preparing for the arrival of her second child. Tiffanie DiDonato, from Swansboro, North Carolina, was born with diastrophic dysplasia and underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries as a child so she would grow to be 4'10 tall, instead of her previous height of 3'8, which is how tall her son Titan currently is. But even with the additional inches, parenting a rambunctious toddler can be difficult for the 34-year-old mom who has certain physical limitations, and often has to use crutches, or sometimes a wheelchair, in addition to being three months pregnant. 'Titan is a typical kid – he wants to do what he wants to do,' she told People of her son. 'And chasing him outside or across the street is not an option for me.' Helping hand: Tiffanie DiDonato, who has diastrophic dysplasia, a rare form of dwarfism, can be seen grocery shopping with her three-year-old son Titan, who is more than half her size, but always willing to assist her . Making it work: The 34-year-old mom from Swansboro, North Carolina, is 4'10 tall and is constantly re-teaching herself to walk because of the stiff muscles and arthritis, which are side effects of her dwarfism . Tiffanie, who married to Eric Gabrielse, a 6’1, 29-year-old Marine who is 6'0, explained that she has to get creative when it comes to dealing with her son - especially when he throws himself on the floor and cries. When tantrums occurs she will walk way and say: 'Mommy can't help when you're yelling at me... No crying and Mommy can help.' Tiffanie noted that this trick, which she has developed over time, usually prompts her son to get up and give her a hug. 'I try my best to let him know throwing tantrums doesn't get you very far - a great lesson to learn, don't you think?' she said. Great news: Tiffanie and her husband Eric Gabrielse, a 29-year-old Marine, are expecting their second child in September . All smiles: Titan happily cuddled up to his dad for this snapshot . Full of life: The three-year-old had a laugh while his dad Eric enjoyed his breakfast . Tiffanie, who co-wrote the memoir Dwarf with Rennie Dyball, has difficulty lifting Titan now that is getting taller because her arms are significantly shorter than most moms. The stiff muscles and arthritis that are side effects of her condition mean that she has to constantly re-teach herself how to walk - which makes chasing after Titan impossible. Losing control of her son is one of her greatest fears, which is why she avoids leaving the house with Titan when she doesn’t her husband Eric or another family member by her side. 'I have even watched Eric struggle to catch him outside and he's a Marine!' she explained. ‘We named Titan correctly, because he's almost too speedy and too athletic.' Because she 'wouldn't stand a chance' against outracing her son, she makes sure she stays '10 steps ahead of the game' at all times. Overcoming obstacles: Tiffanie can be seen as a child wearing braces on her legs. She underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries when she was younger . Painful choice: Tiffanie was expected to be 3'8 tall, but her surgeries allowed her to grow to 4'10, enabling her to be more independent . Tiffanie recalled times in which Titan has climbed into the dryer or wedged himself behind the couch or plopped himself inside the sink. Without physically being able to get him out on her own, she has to rely on her own quick thinking, as well as game she made up to ensure his cooperation. She explained that when she sings: 'One, two, three, help me!' and reaches out for Titan, he will take her hands and pull himself up and out of whatever precarious situation he has gotten himself into. Titan's willingness to lend his mom a helping hand is one of the reasons she is confident that he will be a fantastic big brother. 'He really is - whether he is intentionally doing so or no - becoming my little helper,' she said. 'We conquer the day-to-day challenges together, and I hope we always do.' Sweet moment: Tiffanie and Titan snuggled up together on the couch before he fell asleep . Support system: Tiffanie wore a yellow halter dress while posing for this photo with a friend . Sports fans: Eric and Tiffanie smiled for the camera at a Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium in New York City .

An Old Bailey judge has blasted his junior colleague for ‘taking his eye off the ball’ and passing an 'unlawful' sentence when letting a BT manager dodge jail for a £28,000 expenses scam. Wheelchair-bound  Christopher Starrs, 50, was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in January after admitting his part in a two-and-a-half year con against his employer BT. Starrs, along with fellow BT Openreach manager Phillip Tamplin, invented clamped cars, overtime hours and damage to home owners’ property during broadband installation, and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims. Blasted: Judge Nicholas Cooke QC (left) blasted his junior colleague Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC (right) for 'taking his eye off the ball' when he sentenced Christopher Starrs in January this year . Both Starrs and Tamplin, 53, who made £124,000 from the con, admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses. Tamplin was jailed for two years at January's sentencing hearing, but Mr Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC spared Starrs jail as an ‘act of mercy’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £1,500 fine. However, senior Judge Nicholas Cooke QC has now said the sentence was ‘unlawful’ - and added Starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes. ‘It was an unlawful sentence passed and now I need to do something to put it right, because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter,’ he said. ‘He was mercifully dealt with, sadly by a judge who didn’t have his eye on the ball.’ The judge told Mark Haslam, defending: ‘The sentence was wrong but that’s a matter of personal opinion. ‘Your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison. ‘What the Recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn’t available to him. ‘No one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on Mr Starrs was unlawful. ‘I am sorry to be the headmaster but we really don’t want this sort of thing.’ Fraud: Wheelchair-bound Starrs, 50, was a manager with BT who admitted defrauding the company of £28,000 over two years . The Recorder, who is the head of 4 Bream Buildings chambers and took the Silk in 2006, gave Starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine, and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue. But Judge Cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order. Turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing, he added: ‘This is supposed to be a centre of excellence, when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and can’t do. ‘The judge should have been told what his powers were.’ Prosecutor John Ojakovoh said Starrs offered a ‘blank cheque’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £28,000 he stole. After the judge heard the CPS will now drop the confiscation proceedings, he said the original sentence will stand, quipping: ‘He no doubt thanks his lucky stars.’ Both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time. The main fraudulent claim was for BT vehicles which had been ‘clamped’ by parking authorities. BT Openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work. The company pays out around £1million in fines in London alone every year. Starrs and Tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates. Sentencing Recorder Trimmer, who has led a string of high-profile Serious Fraud Office prosecutions in the last two years, said: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time. ‘It involved over 100 or so false claims, made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity. ‘Both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity. ‘You both knew how it could be conducted, concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally.’ Starrs, of Northolt, Middlesex, who had worked at BT since 1988, was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair. He was not at court today due to a mix-up over whether he was required to attend.

A forensic psychiatrist has testified that Lou Gehrig's disease is the reason a former sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his wife and sister-in-law, whom the defendant described in a suicide note as his threesome partners. Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.

The US body that regulates Internet addresses is looking to crack down on a Canadian company using the new '.sucks' domain name to extract exorbitant sums from celebrities such as Kevin Spacey and companies looking to protect their reputations. So far, purchased names include Youtube.sucks, Bing.sucks, Visa.sucks, Bankofamerica.sucks, Yahoo.sucks, Telusmobility.sucks and other major brand names. Kevin Spacey has reportedly paid have his his '.sucks' domain taken down. Kevin Spacey is reportedly among celebrities paying out to have their name removed from one of the  '.sucks' domains which opened on 30 March . Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains attacking her, CNBC reported. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or 'ICANN,'  sent a letter on Thursday to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Office of Consumer Affairs to see if the actions of company Vox Populi Registry Ltd. were illegal. ICANN initially approved of the so-called top-level domain name, among nearly 600 it has added recently to expand beyond common names such as '.com,' '.org' and '.us.' But it is backtracking after an advisory panel made up of industry groups and companies like Microsoft, Verizon and eBay complained last month. Vox Populi began accepting registrations using '.sucks' on March 30 from trademark holders and celebrities before it is released to public applicants. Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains . It has recommended charging $2,499 a year for the privilege, and according to Vox Populi CEO John Berard, most of the names have been sold by resellers for around $2,000 a year. Berard has said the domain name is meant to create destinations for companies to interact with their critics and called his company's business 'well within the lines of ICANN rules and the law.' Two weeks ago, the advisory body called the Intellectual Property Constituency representing major companies and industry groups asked ICANN in a letter to halt the rollout of '.sucks,' calling it a 'shakedown scheme' and 'predatory.' Companies like GoDaddy.com register some domain names for just $1 a year, and Vox Populi will offer consumers the right to secure a '.sucks' address for just $10 a year starting in September. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme.' ICANN said in its letter that if Canadian or U.S. regulators find Vox Populi's actions are illegal, it could declare the company in breach of its contract and seek to change the registry's behavior. It said it is also seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme .

The semi-final line-up for the Champions League has been confirmed and, although there may be no English involvement, four European giants are just three games from being crowned champions of the continent in Berlin on June 6. With Real Madrid and Juventus winning on Wednesday to join Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the last four, this season's competition is one of the toughest to call in recent memory. We asked our team of reporters who they think will win this season's Champions League. SAMI MOKBEL - Barcelona . Momentum is key at this point in the season and Barcelona are in overdrive. Their early-season woes are a distant memory and Luis Enrique is finally getting his point across. Lionel Messi remains phenomenal and a certain Luis Suarez is hitting top gear just at the right time. Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left) , Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) NEIL ASHTON - Bayern Munich . They overcame their blip (the rip in the seam of Pep's trousers) to power their way beyond Porto in the second leg of the quarter-final and remind everyone just how good they are. They have much to prove after last season's disappointment but they are a phenomenal team. I expect them to draw Barcelona in the semi-final. Bayern Munich produced a stunning display in the second leg to beat Porto in the quarter-finals . JOE BERNSTEIN - Barcelona . Bayern and Barcelona are both better teams than Juventus or Real Madrid and to separate them is nigh on impossible. But given the backroom strife at Bayern, particularly over Arjen Robben's injury, I'd narrowly go for Messi and Barcelona ending their four-year Champions League 'drought'. DOMINIC KING - Barcelona . To think at the start of the season, after Real Madrid pummelled them in the first Clasico, that we thought the beginning of the end had started. Now they look majestic once more and the front three of Messi, Neymar and Suarez gives them an edge over all their rivals. Hopefully it will be a straight shootout between them and Bayern Munich in Berlin. This is the best Champions League semi-final line-up ever and we might get the spectacular final to go with it. LEE CLAYTON - Juventus . Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba and Gianluigi Buffon -  experience, goals and know-how. Tevez isn't Messi (or Cristiano Ronaldo), Pogba isn't Thomas Muller and Buffon isn't Manuel Neuer: Yes, they are ugly bugs on a catwalk of super powers, but they CAN win this. After all, Denmark and Greece both won the Euros. Juventus celebrate their 1-0 aggregate victory over Monaco in the last eight of the Champions League . Juventus striker Carlos Tevez leads the scoring in Serie A this season with 18 goals . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI - Barcelona . Since it's been established that we don't live in a post-Messi (48 goals in 49 starts) world I can't bring myself to bet against him. Would love to see them in a final against Bayern Munich. CHRIS WHEELER - Bayern Munich . After that crushing 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the semi-finals a year ago, and the shock of suffering a 3-1 first-leg loss to Porto in this season’s quarters, expect the real Bayern to stand up and deliver another Champions League triumph for Guardiola. Is it written in the stars that Barcelona will be standing in his way? LAURIE WHITWELL - Barcelona . The front three of Messi, Suarez, and Neymar are beginning to click to devastating effect and the magical allure of Barcelona is returning. It would be some turnaround from the disputes and disappointments of early season, but this is a team full of players who know how to win the trophy. Neymar scored both goals in Barcelona's 2-0 second-leg victory over Paris Saint-Germain at the Nou Camp . LAURA WILLIAMSON - Real Madrid . They might be depleted by injuries but experience and pedigree count in this competition and, as we saw against Atletico Madrid, you can never count against the 10-time winners. Or, indeed, a certain Ronaldo. Javier Hernandez's 88th-minute winner saw Real Madrid edge past their local rivals Atletico Madrid . Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League title and a second in a row with Real Madrid . ROB DRAPER - Bayern Munich . Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben are on the way back, Pep  has a point to prove and the team have the memory of that awful semi-final against Real Madrid last year to drive them on. As long as they don't take their foot off the gas having already won the Bundesliga, they'll make good the disappointment of last year. Robert Lewandowski celebrates one of five first-half goals Bayern Munich scored against Porto on Tuesday . JACK GAUGHAN - Barcelona . I'm tempted to say Bayern Munich but they've got similar buckling deficiencies to the Barcelona we've seen recently. By contrast, the Catalans have found their misplaced defensive steel, have a coach whose win percentage eclipses all to precede him and - well - possess Messi. And Neymar. And Suarez. SAM CUNNINGHAM - Bayern Munich . I would back Guardiola to outwit any of the remaining managers in the tournament with the players at his disposal. Some were writing Bayern Munich off after their 3-1 first-leg defeat by Porto and look how that went. Everyone talks about Messi and Ronaldo, but the collective force of Bayern players is frightening. OLIVER TODD - Barcelona . After a difficult start to the season they've hit form at the right time. Enrique has found a way to get the front three of Messi,  Suarez and Neymar to fire and even if you can keep two of them quiet - as Paris Saint-Germain did on Tuesday - the other will make you pay.

Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.

Steve Davis would love to see Jimmy White and Reanne Evans light up the Crucible stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn. The king of the baize in the 1980s believes the Whirlwind and the doyenne of the women's tour face tall orders to get through qualifying for the Betfred World Championship. Evans saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion Ken Doherty on Thursday, in the first of three preliminary rounds, while White will tackle fellow veteran James Wattana in his opener on Saturday. Steve Davis will attempt to qualify for this year's Betfred World Championship at the Crucible . But Davis, who will also attempt to qualify, expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in Sheffield. He calls 29-year-old Dudley potter Evans 'a great player', and said of the 10-time ladies' world champion: 'It's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods. It's a bun fight, but she's perhaps the best woman player I've ever seen. 'In the 1980s I saw Allison Fisher who was the best around, and she was an excellent, excellent player but more methodical. 'Reanne is more like the Jimmy White or the Ronnie O'Sullivan of the women's game. She has the feel for the game, she's at one with the table. 'She could cause a surprise, but to win three matches is the tough bit. It's hard enough for me and Jimmy. 'If me or Jimmy qualify for the Crucible, it's arguably as big a win as we've ever had. 'I've got a little bit of a desire to do it, but Jimmy would certainly love to get back to the Crucible.' Reanne Evans takes on Ken Docherty for a place at the World Championships in Sheffield . Reanne Evans is a 10-time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010-11 season. She suffered 18 consecutive defeats however and failed to qualify the following year. White, who lost six World Championship finals, last appeared at the tournament in 2006, and has fallen short in qualifying every year since. While 52-year-old White is in the autumn of his career, for Davis these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down. He turns 58 in August and fell off the main tour 12 months ago. A memoir, Interesting, hits the bookshelves on Thursday. A tricky qualifying opener against Jamie Cope could end in disappointment, but it would be short-lived. 'I can't build up the intensity that I used to have, but I must admit I'm getting excited about pitting my wits against another generation of players,' Davis said. 'Of course, it'll all end in tears. 'I'm not totally committed but I still have the juices running through me a little bit. I've been practising but it's not a pretty sight. They're wobbling more in the pockets before saying 'nope'. 'Whether I get to the TV stages, that's a long shot. That's tough. Jimmy White will take on fellow veteran James Wattana in qualifying on Thursday . 'I was still practising hard even when I wasn't getting to the latter stages of the Crucible, and in the end you have to say, 'Yeah, I've tried, but the price is too much investment of time'. 'Now if I've lost a match, by the time I've got in the car I've thought about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day, rather than beating up the person who's come up with me. 'I think it's been a bit like Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I'm sure in the night that someone swapped me for a more mellow version.' Davis won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament, but the 1985 'black-ball final' defeat to Dennis Taylor stands over and above all memories. Dennis Taylor in action during the memorable 1985 World Championship final against Davis . The second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant Davis having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again. 'I don't remember anything as much as I remember the '85 final,' Davis said. 'I do remember the last frame, more so because I've watched it through on video a few times. 'My career was a blur and all games and matches blur into one in the end, it's only the strange moments that do stick in your brain.'

(CNN)Is America a nation divided?  And has Ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions? It's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation: immigration, community and police relations, poverty, education and dozens of other crucial matters facing America. Adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite, and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country. In Ohio, we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services, criminal justice, economic competiveness, infrastructure -- and I've enjoyed sharing our state's winning formula with others in my travels. In 2011, I returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in Congress in the 1980s and '90s.  Over the intervening years, Ohio had lost its way and was hurting. I felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 Ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet. Ohio is much stronger today. And that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing. For example, we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation's strongest state budgets and a nearly $2 billion surplus. We've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones. We've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in America, including tax cuts for the working poor. We're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and Ohio's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade. Getting Ohio back on track wasn't easy. It required big ideas, going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests. Yes, we have a great success story to tell about our state. And we need to make Ohio's success contagious. The leadership style that helped us turn around Ohio is needed in Washington, where America's $18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting Mother's Day if it required their action. Great leaders are not primarily guided by polls, political parties, focus groups, re-election, special interests or protecting the status quo. Instead they bring teams of people together, challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee in Congress in the 1990s, I helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. We worked in a bipartisan effort that doesn't happen enough. There were, of course, disagreements along the way, but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means. Given the polarizing issues facing our country, America needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego, selfishness and power produce. Leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets, tax cuts, welfare reform, border security, immigration and health care. We see it every day. There are certain values that guide great countries: . • Personal responsibility: It obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities. • Empathy: It allows us to walk in someone else's shoes, so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another, better way that makes all of us stronger. • Teamwork: It sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win. • Faith: It tells us we are made special in the image of God with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth. These values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all Americans instead of producing rhetoric, sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform. In Ohio we've implemented this winning strategy. It's worked there, and it will work for the nation as well.

A tortoise has been reunited with his owner after spending nearly a year on the run and even finding a new home - at the age of 109. Owner Wendy Stokes, 74, had given up hope of ever seeing Toby again after he escaped from her garden 11 months ago. But he has now returned home and after piecing together his escapades over the last year, it's become apparent he's had quite an adventure. Reunited: Wendy Stokes, 74, is delighted to have 109-year-old Toby back after his escape 11 months ago . He wandered through a gate in her garden and headed for the open road where he was picked up by a passing driver concerned for his safety and taken to a nearby animal rescue centre. Six months ago, he was re-homed with a couple living in Margate, Kent, 22 miles away from Wendy's farm in West Hougham. But the couple, who could just about make out the word 'Stokes' written in white paint on his shell, felt they needed to find out who Tony belonged to. With nothing else to go on, they decided to call every Stokes in Kent listed in the phonebook. Eventually came across a delighted Wendy, who immediately arranged to collect him. She's had Toby since the 1980s when he was given to her by her late great aunt. He was returned home last Sunday, a full 11 months after his amazing, if a little slow, adventure. Wendy has had Toby since the 1980s and wrote her surname, Stokes, on his back in white paint . Retired farm worker Wendy said: 'I had painted my name and number on the side of his shell but it had faded when he went missing so they couldn't read it. 'The people who found him could read Stokes but they couldn't make out the number. 'He had got out because I had left my gate open. It is normally closed because we have sheep in the paddock but they were in a different field. 'Toby just walked out and trotted towards the road where somebody picked him up and took him to a rescue centre. 'Everyone knows I have a tortoise and we always take him to the village fete so he is a bit of a local celebrity. 'I was devastated when he went missing and spent weeks looking for him in all the fields around the farm.' She added: 'I went all goosey when they told me they had Toby because I had really given up on him. 'It is brilliant having him back and I think everybody was keeping their eye out for him all this time.'

A vicious swan known for terrorising punters and kayakers on the River Cam is now believed to have a grandson following in his footsteps. The savage swan nicknamed Asbaby, which still has many brown baby feathers, has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the Cambridge river. Mr Asbo, the swan believed to be his grandfather, was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 by river authorities after repeatedly attacking rowers. Scroll down for video . Watch out: Savage swan Asbaby has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the river in Cambridge over the Easter weekend . Up close: One resident who lives near the river said Asbaby 'sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers' Theft: Asbaby was seen attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag (above) Capturing the moment: Asbaby (pictured) is believed to be the grandson of Mr Asbo, who was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 . Pecking at the punters: The swan on the River Cam is said to be even more vicious than his father, Asboy, and grandfather, Asbo . Asbaby was seen at the weekend attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag. He is said to have inherited his bad temper from his grandfather, and his father Asboy, who conducted a reign of terror on the river last summer. Harry Crossell, 65, who lives near the river, said: ‘He is even more vicious than his father and grandfather. '(He) sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers. I’ve seen him chasing after punts and taking their picnics. 'Once I even saw him put his beak around a bottle of champagne. ‘It’s terrifying for river users and it’s making people think twice about going out on the water.’ Another resident, Simon Patterson, 52, said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour would get worse as he gets older. ‘The swan is only young at the moment, we’re concerned he will get stronger and more vicious as he grows bigger,’ he said. Shock: The swan got up close with this woman, whose surprise at what was unfolding in front of her could clearly be seen (right) Making an appearance: The juvenile swan nicknamed Asbaby got far too close for comfort to tourists on the Cam over the Easter weekend . Naughty swan: One resident said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour on the River Cam would get worse as he gets older . ‘He swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way. We thought Mr Asbo and Asboy were bad, but this swan is even worse. ‘It’s very worrying as the river is starting to get busier now, if he continues someone could get really hurt.’ But Colin Sparkes, navigation officer for Conservators of the River Cam, told MailOnline today: ‘Most swans get a bit aggressive this time of year. ‘It's mating season - they protect their territory. As far as I’m aware, it's not causing great problems on the river. ‘Swans this time of year start to look out for their nest, and indeed when the young and born. ‘It’s a very tricky one because the more people feed the swans, the more aggressive they tend to become. Close to the camera: Asbaby 'swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way', according to one local resident . Worrying: Asbaby's actions are said to be 'terrifying for river users' and are 'making people think twice about going out on the water' Threatening: The behaviour of Mr Asbo (above) before he was moved 60 miles three years ago left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises . No longer there: The Cam Conservators moved Mr Asbo about 60 miles away in 2012. His son Asboy is seen above in this file photograph . 'They get used to swimming up to people expecting to be fed.’ He confirmed that there are no plans to remove Asbaby from the river, adding that the case of Mr Asbo was completely different. Mr Sparkes said: ‘That swan (Mr Asbo) was extremely aggressive - it's the most aggressive swan I've ever come across. ‘I believe that was probably down to the way he'd been brought up looking for food from various people.’ The Conservators moved Mr Asbo away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself. His behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises - and a marshal was employed during a university rowing race to stop him injuring students. It has previously been reported how Asboy was seen attacking punters, birds and even a cow. He also injured a canoeist and a swimmer.

The Conservative know that they need to turn large parts of the country blue on May 7. And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate Alec Shelbrooke in Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.

After months of speculation - and years of her friends' doubts - Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has admitted she never had cancer. With her business empire destroyed and her online community in tatters, Gibson today admitted her fatal cancer 'diagnoses' were lies. 'No. None of it is true,' she said, during a series of interviews published in the latest edition of the Australian Women's Weekly. In the interviews - which questioned her relationship with the truth and her understanding of cancer - Gibson said she was not seeking forgiveness. 'I don't want forgiveness. I just think (it) was the responsible thing to do. Above anything, I would like people to say, 'Okay, she's human'. Gibson's confession was the first time she has spoken publicly since - under fire from furious former fans - she told Daily Mail Australia she feared for her family's safety. Scroll down for video . Ms Gibson revealed the truth of her cancer diagnosis in an interview . Ms Gibson, pictured kissing her son Olivier, 4, on the head, said: 'None of it was true' Her business empire in tatters and her relationship with her fans broken, Ms Gibson is thought to be struggling financially. The Women's Weekly said she was not paid for her interview . Ms Gibson's interview will be published in this month's edition of the Australian Women's Weekly . The wellness blogger was a prominent Australian social media personality. Her Instagram fan base ballooned after she 'revealed' she had prolonger her life by embracing an alternative lifestyle. Her 'whole foods' business became famously successful. Penguin published her recipe book and her app was to be offered on the Apple Watch. But it all fell apart last month after revelations emerged Ms Gibson had failed to fulfil promised donations to various charities. Friends then began to cast doubts about her cancer diagnoses. She then tearfully 'admitted' she may have been 'misdiagnosed' by a 'Dr Phil'. The  Weekly insists it did not pay for the story and that it was approached by Ms Gibson's 'people', the Melbourne 'corporate advisory' firm Bespoke Approach. Ms Gibson said her partner, Clive Rothwell, was sticking by her in spite of the controversy. But she said he had taken a 'stern' line with her and insisted she play a straight bat. 'He’s been very stern, along the lines of, ‘I just want you to acknowledge where you’ve f***ed up and try not to smooth over that,' she was quoted saying. In the article, titled 'My Lifelong Struggle With The Truth', Ms Gibson also said she had been forced to raise herself from the day she started school. She said she took upon common household responsibilities, such as bringing her brother to school and making lunches. But she would not provide her mother's name or contact details to the magazine. In her previous interview, Ms Gibson said she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion'. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) was also a popular app. It will not appear on the Apple Watch any longer . But she took aim at many of her former fans who she believed had responded 'maliciously' - claiming that her son's childcare details, home address and floor plan were published online. Former friends had called upon Ms Gibson to 'come clean' with the truth about her situation and had long privately questioned the veracity of her story. Authorities told Daily Mail Australia  at the beginning of April that Ms Gibson is still facing an official investigation. A former friend of Ms Gibson directly called on her to 'come clean' in an interview with Daily Mail Australia in March. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want'

A ‘unique and beautiful’ teenage girl was killed by a driver who crashed a stolen car while drunk and high on cocaine and cannabis. Xana Doyle, 19, was a passenger in the Toyota Avensis, which flipped and landed on its roof in an accident in the early hours of the morning. Driver Sakhawat Ali, 23, was more than twice the drink-drive limit and had been taking class A and B drugs before getting behind the wheel. Xana Doyle (pictured) was killed after driver Sakhawat Ali crashed a stolen car while high on drugs . The Toyota Avensis flipped and landed on its roof after the crash in the early hours of the morning in January . A court heard he was driving at ‘excessive speed’ in the moments before the crash, which did not involve any other vehicle. Miss Doyle, who suffered a ‘blunt head injury’, was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales. Ali admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday. Judge Neil Bidder QC told the court: ‘The driver was well over twice the drink-drive limit and it is accepted there was excessive speed.’ The judge said he wanted more information on how much cocaine and cannabis the driver had taken on the night of the smash before sentencing. Ali, of Newport, was remanded in custody ahead of a hearing in July. Sakhawat Ali (pictured right) admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking . The driver’s cousin, Shabaz Ali, 21, admitted allowing himself to be carried in a stolen car following the smash in January this year. The July hearing will decide whether he ‘contributed’ to the accident by pulling the handbrake from the back seat. Floral tributes were left at the scene of the accident and hundreds of people attended the funeral of Miss Doyle, a former Duffryn High School student, in January. In a tribute, her mother Emma O’Donoghue wrote that Xana was an ‘unusual name for a unique and beautiful girl’. Before the crash, Miss Doyle, from Newport, had recently begun working at Wetherspoons as a cook and was also a trained beautician after completing an apprenticeship. Ms O’Donoghue said yesterday: ‘No sentence will ever give me back my daughter or my children their sister. She is dearly missed and this terribly traumatic experience will remain with us for ever. ‘I am pleased that Sakhawat Ali has pleaded guilty, not that he could dispute any of the evidence presented. Miss Doyle suffered a 'blunt head injury' and was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales . Ali was remanded in custody and a hearing in July will determine if his cousin also contributed to the crash . ‘Xana was a beautiful, funny and loving girl and every day is a struggle to live on without her in our lives, we can only hope that justice is served and those responsible are held accountable.’ Paying tribute to Miss Doyle at her funeral, her mother said: ‘You had a smile that would stop this world spinning around. ‘I always knew that you were kind and loving and even through your difficult teenage years you never forgot to tell me how much you loved me and appreciated my support. ‘In the last two years you blossomed into a beautiful young woman, independent and hard-working, making us all so proud of you.’ She added that she had fond memories of her daughter playing and fooling around with her sisters, Lauren and Eve, and her brother Zane. Miss Doyle, whose white coffin was adorned with red roses, gave ‘unquivering friendship and support’ to her friends and family throughout her life, her mother added.

I couldn’t get over her face, and some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, "Oh my God that’s my face." 'I can’t remember the number of times I said "this is so freaky". It was truly amazing.' Karen, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Niamh has a brother and two sisters, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Niamh said the pair got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities.

Since meeting, Niamh and Karen - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly'. Karen (right) turned out to be a fellow Ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from Niamh (left), making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together . She added, 'Some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, "Oh my God that’s my face"' While Niamh appears to have beaten her fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry and 22-year-old Terence, hands down, the search isn't over until April 27. 'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry says. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!'

Niamh, who is still promoting the project across social media with Harry and Terence as interest spreads, says there will be no prize for the winner, just 'pride'. They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' Niamh states. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?'

It may have been invented for students to use. But youngsters appear to be deserting Facebook in droves because it is now so popular with their parents – and grandparents. Almost a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’. The trend comes as increasing numbers of older users turn to the social network to stay in touch and share family pictures. Nearly 60 per cent of Britons aged over 55 now have a Facebook account, according to research. Facebook has even started running television adverts to entice the so-called ‘silver surfers’ to join. Now a survey of around 2,000 Britons has revealed that it is having the opposite effect on youngsters. ‘As parents are signing up, their children are logging off to maintain privacy,’ said Lord Jim Knight, chairman of online lobby group the Tinder Foundation. In the poll, a third of Facebook users are said to have blocked a family member so they can no longer see their account or do not receive automatic updates. The survey did not take account of the number of youngsters who have effectively blocked their family members by refusing to add them as a ‘Facebook friend’ in the first place. One in ten people aged 16 to 34 signed up to other platforms so they could remain ‘under the radar of their parents’. But whilst youngsters may be leaving Facebook, they are not giving up on social media altogether. More than half said they had joined Twitter, where only 13 per cent of ‘silver surfers’ said they have accounts. Meanwhile, about 40 per cent of youngsters use the picture-sharing website Instagram, according to the study commissioned by Halifax and carried out by Opinium Research. Logging off: Nearly a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their facebook accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’ Around the same proportion use Snapchat, a social media platform which automatically deletes messages shortly after they are sent. The picture was very different among the over-55s. Just three percent have an Instagram account and even fewer – around one percent – use Snapchat. The way people use these different social platforms is also changing. Around a fifth of those aged 16 to 34 use their smartphones at family dinners, posing a threat to the precious mealtimes that used to be the cornerstone on family life. By comparison, just one percent of silver surfers use their smartphones during a meal with their offspring.

Alan Pardew has warned Crystal Palace's Barclays Premier League admirers that if they want to sign Yannick Bolasie this summer then the bidding will have to start at £20million. It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.' Bolasie scores against Sunderland as he helped Crystal Palace beat the struggling Premier League side .

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini accepts his side are now facing a fight to stay in the Champions League places. City appear to have lost too much ground to Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race and their recent form has led to a further worry, with the sides behind them catching fast. The fading champions could even find themselves in fourth place before they next play - at Crystal Palace on Monday - if results go against them over the weekend. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) shakes hands with David Silva during Manchester City training . Martin Demichelis (left), Wilfried Bony (centre) and Fernando during Friday's session . Frank Lampard (right) looks to play a pass as he and his team-mates are put through their paces . This is not a battle they envisaged having to fight at the start of the campaign but Pellegrini realises nothing can be taken for granted after a frustrating second half of the season. Pellegrini said: 'I think in this league you can never be sure you are going to have a Champions League place. You have six or seven teams that, from the beginning, all of them play for that position. 'At the moment, for the whole year, we have been in a position of the Champions League. I hope that we will continue.' Pellegrini believes his side are now in a battle for the Champions League places and not the title . Manchester City have struggled to keep up with Chelsea, who are closing in on the Premier League trophy . The ramifications of dropping out of the top four, however, are not really something Pellegrini wants to consider, given that he still has hopes of landing the title. With just eight games remaining and a significant deficit to make up on Chelsea that looks a forlorn task, but Pellegrini is not giving up. The Chilean said: 'Of course if we want to continue in the first position of the table we must not drop any more points. It is easy to say but not easy to do it. 'We just know that from now until the end of the season we will try to win all the games and we will see if we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end.' Sergio Aguero has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks but will hope to find the net on Monday . James Milner is in line to return after withdrawing from the England squad with a knee problem . City will hope to be at full strength for the trip to Selhurst Park. Pellegrini reported nothing other than 'small problems' when asked about any injury concerns at his pre-match press conference. That means a likely return for key midfielder Yaya Toure, who missed the 3-0 victory over West Brom a fortnight ago with an Achilles problem but has since played for Ivory Coast. Fellow midfielder James Milner has also been troubled by a knee problem in recent weeks - and withdrew from England's midweek friendly in Italy - but the issue is not thought serious.

Radamel Falcao could still sign permanently for Manchester United after it emerged that chief executive Ed Woodward held talks with Monaco on Sunday over the striker’s future. Falcao, who has scored just four times for United since his season-long loan move from Monaco, drew another blank at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea on Saturday evening. But Woodward told Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev last Sunday that they would make a decision on the right to sign him permanently at the end of the season. Manchester United could sign Radamel Falcao permanently after holding talks with Monaco on Sunday . The striker has endured a frustrating season on loan at Man United and has managed just four league goals . Vasilyev said: ‘I saw the Manchester United people last Sunday and they have not yet decided if they would exercise the option.. ‘It’s not his best season, but they kept the opportunity to make a decision at the end of the season.’ Although it seems highly unlikely that United will keep the Colombian striker, Falcao has been given hope of a second chance under Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Under the terms of the original loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the forward, but it has since emerged that Monaco are willing to negotiate on the transfer fee after a disappointing season at United. Vasilyev added: ‘We are not in any other negotiations, even if big clubs are interested. The decision is with Manchester, then we will discuss with the player what he wants. I would like to have more visibility.’ Falcao missed last summer’s World Cup in Brazil following a knee injury and it is thought he rushed his recovery in an attempt to play in the tournament for Colombia. Under the terms of the loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the striker but Monaco are willing to negotiate . Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward spoke with Monaco president Vasim Vasilyev on Sunday . Vasilyev added: ‘He had mishaps in Monaco. He had problems with the coach Claudio Ranieri, there was a lack of understanding. ‘He was also seriously injured and missed the World Cup. In late August, he came to tell us that he wanted to play at a higher level.” Ranieri has since been replaced by Leonardo Jardim and he has backed Falcao to rediscover his goalscoring form after a frustrating season at United. Jardim, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Juventus in the Stade Louis II, is preparing for his return at the end of the season. Jardim, speaking ahead of his side's home clash with Juventus, is confident Falcao can get back to his best . The Portuguese coach said: ‘He’s not had a great season that is true, but I’m sure he can come back to the levels he was at in the past - that much I’m convinced about. ‘It’s not a question for me, but for the players, I’ve only worked with him for a month.’ Monaco lost the first leg last week in the Juventus Stadium to a controversial penalty and face Massimiliano Allegri’s team in the second leg.

An aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed Germanwings passenger plane may had its electronics 'hacked' before it crashed killing all 150 on board. The theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected Financial Times newspaper from aviation boss Matt Andersson, president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace. The French Alps tragedy which occurred on the flight between Barcelona to Dusseldorf has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28. He is believed to have barricaded himself in the cockpit of the GermanWings A320 Airbus before flying the packed plane into the mountainside as the captain fought desperately to get inside. Scroll down for video . Disaster: An aviation expert says an external factor like 'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the Germanwings plane crash that claimed 150 lives . Tragedy: The crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who investigators say locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet . Investigation: But Matt Andersson - president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace - says any number of causes could have caused the crash . Doomed: Recordings from the cockpit suggested that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (left) locked himself in the cockpit while the Captain Patrick Sondenheimer desperately tried to break in . Investigators point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer. Mr Andersson says the French accident investigators are clear that the stricken plane 'accelerated in its descent'. But he writes in the FT: 'That may be, but it could be from any number of causes, including external electronic hacking into the aircraft's control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception.' 'This is one reason military and head-of-state aircraft are generally installed with specific shielding and additional active protective measures,' and he stresses: 'Civilian aircraft are not.' Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries and come to a firm conclusion. He added: 'The public should patiently wait for a through, multi-party professional air safety investigation, while maintaining an independence of judgment over preliminary official hypotheses.' Setting out his doubts about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary findings, Mr Andersson said: 'Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) of the Germanwings flight 9525 have yet to be subject to international standards. 'Until they are, many broad assertions currently presented to the public may turn out to be erroneous, misleading or in some cases lead to improper or counterproductive regulatory and other reactions –including misplaced liability, financial and insurance claims.' Damaged: Despite revelations from the plane's flight data recorders (pictured), Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries . Aftermath: He claims passenger planes do not have the same level of protection as military jets and someone could have hacked into its 'control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception' Since the crash, European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck, requiring a member of cabin crew to step in if one of the two pilots leaves the cockpit. Mr Andersson writes in the FT that the 'slow drip' of piecemeal judgments from preliminary assessments of data can be counterproductive. He said the European Cockpit Association representing nearly 40,000 professional pilots 'has rightly criticised the premature release' of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder. Investigators say this highlights the co-pilot breathing while locked in the cockpit while the pilot beats on the door outside. Protection: Since the crash which is believed to be caused by 28-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck . Police carried out forensic searches on Lubitz's and his parents house after it emerged that he 'deliberately' crashed the Airbus A320 jet into the Alps . He believes premature release 'could arguably prejudice a formal technical assessment' and Mr Andersson is not the only aviation expert to speculate on the plane being 'hacked'. Former commercial pilot Jay Rollins told US television channel MSNBC last month: 'This aircraft is highly computerised. 'There's one possibility that no-one has brought up. I wonder – could this be a hacking incident?' He drew parallels with the loss of a US drone over Iran, which some blamed on electronic hacking: 'Suddenly the aircraft responding to outside forces. 'If something like that were going on it would be very disturbing for the pilot.'

Lindsay Lohan has been living in London for the past year and says she likes it so much, she doesn't see herself returning to the States any time soon. The 28-year-old flame-haired beauty recently spent a stint on the stage, starring in a West End production of David Mamet’s Speed The Plow - for which she received lukewarm reviews - and seems intent on remaining in the UK for the foreseeable future. ‘[London] feels like home, I miss it every time I have to leave for work and can’t wait to get back,’ Lindsay told Homme Style Magazine while posing for a stunning and seductive shoot for the publication. ‘I go back to NYC and LA for family and work.’ Scroll down for video . Staying put: Lindsay Lohan says she feels 'at home' in London and has no plans to return to the States just yet . Fleur Du Mal Leather Corset . Available at Forward by Elyse Walker . Visit site . We haven't heard much from Lindsay in the US since she moved across the pond to London. But if her latest photo shoot for Homme Style magazine is any indication, she's making a comeback in a major way. The Mean Girls star showed of her svelte figure in a series of racy ensembles by Moschino and Agent Provacateur. Here she poses wearing nothing but a Fleur Du Mal leather corset, La Perla panties, and a pair of Moschino gloves. Corsets were hot on the Spring runways at Givenchy and Versace and continue to be a wardrobe staple for sultry celebs like Madonna and Kim Kardashian. Lindsay's leather number is available to purchase for just under $1,000. That's quite a big budget for lingerie, so we've come up with some alternatives that are less pricey but still have major sex appeal.

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same "situations" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'

Designer Lilly Pulitzer's family learned that it's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the 'Pink Sunday' rush for the late Ms Pulitzer’s eponymous brand’s brightly-colored, limited edition collaboration at Target. The 250-piece Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the #LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.'

Protesters have demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons during a protest against the gentrification of South London. The store front of its Brixton branch was covered in shattered glass while 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' was spray painted in black across their housing advertisements. A police spokesman confirmed that one man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Thousands of people turned up for the event organised by the Reclaim Brixton group who were demonstrating against local residents and businesses being priced out of the trendy area. One of the event's organisers denounced the violent actions of 'one idiot' but told MailOnline there could be a reason Foxtons - which has a reputation for selling expensive homes - has been 'continuously targeted'. Scroll down for video . Vandal: One vandal smashed the front window of Foxtons Brixton branch (pictured) during a 'wholly peaceful' protest against rising house prices in London . Violent: The lone protester demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons, who have a reputation for selling expensive houses . Defaced: The vandal then spray painted 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' on the estate agent's housing advertisements . Reputation: A spokesperson for Reclaim Brixton - who organised the event - denounced the man's violent actions but suggested there could be a reason Foxtons is 'continuously targeted' Motive: Cyndi Anaso said she is not happy about the vandalism but told MailOnline 'it suggests there's a reason they are being targeted' Response: Police at the scene in Brixton (pictured) had to us CS spray to disperse a group of violent protesters . Cyndi Anaso from Reclaim Brixton told MailOnline said she was 'saddened' that someone behaved 'deviantly' during a wholly peaceful demonstration. But she claims the upmarket estate agents have been targeted before, adding: 'Foxtons has a very poor reputation when it comes to expensive properties and unfortunately.' 'There's a message in it which I'm not happy about but it still suggests there's a reason they are being targeted. 'There's never an endorsement of the attack but nothing else on the day can be considered even slightly violent.' 'I don't even think it's right to apologise for these individuals because every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window.' Foxtons is widely considered as a sign of gentrification and its presence is an indicates that an area either is or has the potential to become very affluent. The Reclaim Brixton event was planned to demonstrate against the rising property prices in London which the group believes is 'displacing the city's communities'. A statement on the Facebook page for the event said: 'The fight against gentrification starts here! Brixton is widely known for its vibrancy, which is another word for social and cultural diversity. Keeping watch: There is still a 'police presence' outside the vandalised store in Brixton, South London following the incident . Defence: Sympathisers and Brixton locals used Twitter to condemn the attention being given to the 'isolated' act of vandalism . Break-in: The Metropolitan Police (pictured) also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall, but were removed shortly after and no arrests were made . 'But Brixton's vibrancy now has a question mark on it. Will Brixton turn into a living museum or will it live?' But alongside images of people protesting peacefully on the streets, social media has been flooded with images of hordes pushing past police and the Foxtons window being destroyed. A police spokesman added: 'A group of protesters then made their way to Brixton Road where the window of a commercial premises was smashed and graffiti sprayed on the building.' Police used CS spray on 'a small group of protesters' who went into Brixton Police Station at around 4.10pm before being removed shortly afterwards. The Metropolitan Police also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall at around 3.15pm, saying: 'Officers entered the building and the protesters were removed.' Grace Lally from Lambeth Housing Activists said the demonstration had attracted thousands of people. Smashed: A Reclaim Brixton spokesperson said: 'Every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window' She added: 'The protest has been lively and strong and loud and people have hung banners off the town hall, blocked the streets and marched through Brixton a number of times and stopped traffic.' Ms Lally insisted the protest was 'really lively' but there had been 'no violence or trouble or anything like that'. Those sympathetic to Reclaim Brixton's protest and locals of the area have taken to Twitter to denounce isolated incidents of violence. Regarding the smashed window, Vanessa Furey from London said: 'Whilst sympathetic to the sentiment, idiots who have done this will have taken away what Reclaim Brixton was about.' And Louise Ridley wrote: 'I live in Brixton. I want people to know about extortionate rents and evictions. But I don't want windows smashed, anywhere.'

(CNN)Pushed to his limits, a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class. In an email to his students, Irwin Horwitz accused them of "backstabbing, game playing, cheating, lying, fighting." The professor at the Texas A&M University Galveston Campus expected his missive would create some conflict, but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly. Those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage. The story went viral. Suddenly, his name was spreading on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, accompanied by the kind of strong, unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you've never met. He was a hero who taught today's entitled youth a much-needed lesson, or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit. One thing was certain: He, and his employer, were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for. "I did what I did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the Internet," Horwitz said. "I will stand by what I did, but I'm not career suicidal." Texas A&M says Horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching. But Horwitz, a nontenure-track professor in the maritime administration program, is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs. Horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial, and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class. The day before writing to his students, Horwitz wrote a similar email to the CEO of the Texas A&M Galveston Campus and to the school's chief academic officer. "I have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful, dishonest and disrespectful" as his current strategic management class, he wrote to the administrators. He accused the students of shirking responsibility, making excuses and complaining their way to better grades. He would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class, Horwitz wrote. "The class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic," he wrote. "But they are your problem now." It was the next day that Horwitz wrote to the students, calling the class "an embarrassment in general," and said that "I am frankly and completely disgusted." Once his words echoed in traditional and social media, the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone. The story was such a talker that even The Onion offered a parody. "I'm not looking to fail students," Horwitz said. "I don't get a bonus for failing students." "The letter sounded a little bit more definite than I wanted it to," he added. He never actually changed anyone's grade. There were some students he wasn't going to fail, he said, and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out. But Horwitz stands by his tough stance; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed, he said. The course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses. "I had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break-even analysis," the professor said. "If you cannot do a break-even analysis, then you don't deserve a bachelor's degree in business." His other complaint was about professionalism. Horwitz said students would swear at him, cheat and spread rumors about him online. This is related to their grades, he said, because dealing with people you don't like is a business skill. On online message boards, users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story. One purported student called Horwitz "a little obnoxious," but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules. Should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral? The fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public, but maybe there is more to it. The situation hits on a popular argument on the media and Internet: What do we think of millennials? Reflecting on his most recent class, Horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered. He mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics, and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration. The other factor is a failure of K-12 education, said Horwitz, who has met college students who don't know how to convert fractions to decimals. "What I'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance," he said. In a statement, Patrick Louchouarn, the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at Texas A&M Galveston Campus, said the entire class will not be failed. "Each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester," Louchouarn said. "The university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies." The flurry of attention is unwelcome and Horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia. But it's likely his story will have a short shelf life. People probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline. But he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere. He said he feels a public shaming of sorts. Online public shaming has become a research topic of its own. People who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance. "This is really destroying my life," Horwitz said.

Stop!'" she said. 'It was really making us uncomfortable,' her father said. The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. He says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders. There were no protests as of 7 p.m. Jeanne and Ken Gumm from outside LaPorte, about 20 miles northwest of Walkerton, said they had been waiting for the pizzeria to reopen so they could show their support. 'We couldn't wait to get down here," said Ken Gumm, 66, a tank truck driver. 'To us this whole thing isn't about gay marriage. It's mostly about freedom of religion.'

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today left the door open to a second referendum on Scottish independence before 2020. Before last year's historic vote, Scottish nationalists insisted it was a once-in-a-generation chance to decided on the future of the 300-year-old Union. But Ms Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' In September's vote, 55 per cent of Scots backed the idea of remaining in the United Kingdom. Alex Salmond said the vote was an 'opportunity of a lifetime' and two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: 'We have always said it's a once in a generation thing.' But in a series of TV election debates between Scottish leaders, Ms Sturgeon has shifted her position and today left open the possibility that the promise of another vote could be included in a future SNP manifesto. Under pressure she said that 'something would have to change' before she promised a referendum, and people would have to vote for it. She said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, there is not another referendum on the cards. 'In order for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future, something significant would have to change from the situation we had last year in the referendum.' Ms Sturgeon, who was campaigning in Paisley today, left open the idea of demanding a referendum in next year's Scottish Parliament elections . Opponents claim Ms Sturgeon had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on a referendum, after insisting last year's vote was a once in a generation event . During a fractious and at times shouty debate on BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged her to rule out another vote. Ms Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: 'You clearly don't want to tell people before they vote in this election, what will happen in the next election. 'You have a conference coming up in September, you have 80,000 new members who might be popping along, are you going to put a motion at your conference on this to put a referendum into your next manifesto?' Ms Sturgeon said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, I haven't published the 2016 manifesto. It will be this time next year before we publish the 2016 one.' Mr Rennie said the SNP leader had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on another referendum. He said: 'People need to know whether their vote for the SNP this time round will trigger a referendum in the SNP's manifesto in 2016. Nicola Sturgeon's refusal to answer this basic question makes clear that Scotland faces neverendum. 'It matters because during the referendum we know the SNP took their eye off the ball. As a result, public services were neglected. 'We have seen from Canada the economic impact of an uncertain constitutional environment. Quebec lost jobs and wealth. That damaged the province in the long term. I want a Scotland which builds a stronger economy and a fairer society, balancing the books and delivering more powers.' During a TV debate, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged Ms Sturgeon to come clean on her plans for Scotland . Ms Sturgeon later accused her opponents of 'reviving Project Fear'. The First Minister was questioned about SNP plans to increase Scotland's financial powers, which economists have suggested would leave a £7.6 billion spending gap, during a third televised election debate in under a week. Ms Sturgeon said that full fiscal autonomy would take several years to implement but with new powers Scotland would start growing its economy and revenues. She said: 'This week we've seen the Project Fear that dominated the referendum revived by these three unionist parties, trying to talk down Scotland and assert that we're not capable of running our own affairs.' Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said: 'This (the figure) didn't come from us. You're right in saying this came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It also came from a group of Scottish-based economists that projected the gap to be bigger.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: 'To make this £7.6 billion up Scotland would have to grow at twice the rate of the rest of entire advanced world, so how would you do that Nicola?'

A night of violence gave way to a day of mourning Sunday for a man who died after sustaining serious injuries while in the custody of Baltimore police. Over several hours on Sunday afternoon, a steady stream of mourners filed into the Vaughn Green East funeral home for a wake for Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who died a week after an encounter with police left him with grave spinal injuries. Mourners passed by Gray's silk-draped, white coffin where he lay dressed in a white shirt, black pants, white sneakers and an all-white Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap. Scroll down for video .

Mourners also gathered outside. Some held up signs that read, 'We remember Freddie' and 'Our Hearts Are With The Gray Family.' Melissa McDonald, 36, who said she was Gray's cousin, wore a shirt with 'Freddie Forever' printed on the back. She described her cousin as a nonviolent person. 'He didn't deserve to die the way he did,' she said. A number of mourners like Tina Covington, 46, said they didn't know the family but came to express their condolences.

Covington said that 'there is something going on in the police department that needs to change.' Gray's funeral is planned for Monday. At a church service earlier Sunday, Pastor Jamal Bryant told churchgoers, including members of Gray's family, at Empowerment Temple AME Church that 'somebody is going to have to pay' for Gray's death.

Roughly 1,200 protesters gathered at City Hall on Saturday afternoon, officials said, to protest Gray's death, which has prompted near-daily demonstrations since he died April 19. Gray was arrested one week before that when officers chased him through a West Baltimore neighborhood and dragged him into a police van. However, a smaller group splintered off and looted a convenience store and smashed storefront windows. A protester tossed a flaming metal garbage can toward police officers in riot gear trying to push back the crowd. Earlier, a group of protesters smashed windows of at least three police cars. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a long-time congressman representing Baltimore's 7th District, told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that there is deep frustration over the case. 'Mr. Gray died a week ago. And I think the thing that upset so many people was the fact that here's a young man. We still don't know exactly why he was arrested,' Cummings said. 'We do know that he was hollering out for aid. He was not given aid after being arrested. ... A lot of people are very, very frustrated as to trying to figure out what happened here, and it's very upsetting.'

Police acknowledged Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested — before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the Police Department's policy. Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray asked for medical help several times, beginning before he was placed in the van. After a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.

A volleyball-playing feline was picked to star in a national TV advert after seeing off competition from thousands of gifted animals. Tortoiseshell Mimi became an internet sensation after her owner uploaded clips of her playing the sport to Facebook. The 30-second-video was shared by thousands of people around the world and features the one-year-old cat playing with 15-year-old Joshua Teague. Joshua’s dad Phil, 56, a computer programmer, bought the cat with his wife Christine, 45, when she was eight-weeks-old in December 2013 from a seller who lived in Birmingham. Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert, which was broadcast last Wednesday (15), after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group earlier this month. He said: 'All the family were really excited to see the advert. Mimi the cat appears in a 30-second video showing her unique ball skills . 'We had everyone around so we could watch it together and we told all our friends that it was going to be on. 'I am really proud that our video was chosen out of thousands of entries. 'It was completely by chance that I uploaded the video on to the Pets At Home Facebook page. The cat is seen playing volleyball with 15-year-old Joshua Teague in the hallway . Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group . 'I just saw something on there asking people to share videos and pictures of their pets so that’s what I did. I didn’t even realise it was a competition. 'The video showed Mimi playing volleyball with my son where he would throw the ball at her and she would keep batting it back. 'I had no idea it was competition so I thought it was a joke when I received an email on April 1 saying our video had been chosen for a national commercial. Mimi is seen in the video batting the ball back to Joshua every time he throws it her way . 'This kind of thing just never happens. 'She is a very talented cat. She has done many times since. 'I think she could get her own TV show.' Administrative assistant Christine said: 'I didn’t even know Phil had uploaded the video on Facebook so I thought it was an April Fools’ joke when he told me about it. 'We normally just skip the adverts when we watch programmes but we made sure to watch this one. 'Although she’s only in the advert for a few seconds, it’s nice to see her on it. 'I never thought when I filmed the video that it would end up on TV.'

Controversial Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans is under attack again with experts warning his 'reworked' baby milk formula is dangerous to babies. Dietitians have singled out a 'happy tummy brew' in Evans' cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, because it contains almost five times the maximum vitamin A dose for a baby. The original recipe for the 'brew' contained more than 10 times the maximum daily intake of vitamin A for babies. Scroll down for video . The paleo diet has been one of the hottest diet trends around, with celebrity followers taking on the lifestyle . The Dieticians Association of Australia said the reworked formula still presents a threat to babies. 'This new infant 'brew' could seriously harm babies,' a spokeswoman for the Dieticians Association of Australia told News Corp Australia. 'The authors seem to have made a serious mistake with this second version of their liver and broth recipe, suggesting they do not understand the basic scientific and nutrition information relevant for infant feeding. 'They have said publicly that they have tried to make it safe by reworking the original recipe, and increasing the age for which it's suggested from 0-6 months to now be 6-12 months, but they have failed spectacularly to meet any safe standards.' The paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle . Evans's co-authors, wellness blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padrin, told Channel 7 last week the dangerous formula had been reworked and renamed 'Happy Tummy Brew'. The pair told the program the recipe had changed. 'We added vitamin C and some calcium,'Carr told The Morning Show. It comes after Evans' recently shared two stories on his social media accounts of women who claimed the paleo diet helped alleviate the symptoms of their multiple sclerosis. A 30-year-old woman, Hollie, wrote she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in September 2013. She said that she endured months of  constant dizziness, altered temperature perception, extreme fatigue, numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression. But after jumping on the Paleo diet bandwagon, Hollie claimed she has not suffered any MS symptoms over the past 12 months, her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever. Hollie's experience led the celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000-plus followers on Facebook on Saturday. Pete Evans has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis . 'WOW this is powerful story on MS, thanks for sharing Hollie.. it will make your heart sing.. it has mine, please tag and share wide!' Evans wrote. The Australian chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg, another MS sufferer. The woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on Evans' 10 weeks Paleo program. The celebrity chef has been a proud paleo advocate . 'I have had a lot of health issues the past years, mainly auto-immune stuff including MS,' she wrote in the online post. 'Having MS means I'm always sapped of energy, have numbness, pins and needles, pain, poor concentration, etc. Not any more!' Marg said she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs. 'No way on earth I could have done that 10 weeks ago,' she wrote. 'My concentration and memory is much better and I can also plan better. I'm not off my MS meds yet but I am off my Thyroid and Reflux meds. 'Thanks so much Pete and team for helping me get my life back. You've made this road so easy. As an added bonus I've gone from a size 16 to a size 12.' The My Kitchen Rules judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy. But, Hollie praised Evans for his endorsement of the controversial diet, and said 'the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable'. 'I have been inspired by your encouragement, great recipes and educated by the accurate information you provide,' Hollie wrote. 'Pete, I thank you so very much for bringing paleo in to the mainstream - people no longer look at me as though I'm a weirdo for following this way of life.' In another recent Facebook post, the Australian chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg who also suffers from MS . Evans has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman 'diet' LaTrobe University Associate Professor of Dietetics Catherine Itsiopoulos pointed out Hollie's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the Paleo lifestyle. 'Her diet may have been poor previously,' Dr Itsiopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we don't know what her diet and eating habits were like before. 'By eating lean meat, good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together. 'But we don't actually know if her condition is cured so it's hard to advocate on because there's no scientific evidence to back this up.' The paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar . University of South Australia Professor of Population, Health and Nutrition Kerin O'Dea said while the diet seemed to have worked for Hollie, it might not work for others. 'Pete can share whatever he likes to his followers but there's never going to be one magic bullet to cure an illness or a serious disease,' Dr O'Dea told Daily Mail Australia. 'Someone reporting an anecdote might be true in one person's case but it's very difficult to imply it to others, which can be quite misleading for people. The paleo style of eating, which Pete Evans is a proud supporter of, has been sweeping across the globe . 'They could feel failure when it doesn't work for them, especially when they try to cure a serious condition like this. 'I wouldn't recommend any particular diet for anyone suffering any type of illnesses.' The paleo style of eating, which Evans is a proud supporter of, has swept  the globe and involves a high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruits, seeds and nuts.

(CNN)A popular Chinese television host known for impromptu satire is now the subject of controversy after being caught on camera cursing the late Chairman Mao Zedong. Bi Fujian, who works for state-run China Central Television, was filmed at a dinner party singing a revolutionary song that eulogizes the Communist Party's early years when he started going off script. "The Communist Party, Chairman Mao. Don't mention that old son of a b***h. He made us suffer so bad," went Bi's improvised lyrics. The other dinner guests burst into laughter. Bi later apologized. "My personal speech has led to grave social consequences, and I feel remorseful for that. I hereby sincerely apologize to the public. As a public figure, I shall learn the lesson from this incident, adhering to strict self-discipline," he posted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform. Making disrespectful references to China's leaders in public is considered a taboo in China, even today. And Bi's comment was directed at the man regarded by many as the country's founding father -- despite his controversial reputation. The 75-second video clip, seemingly filmed on the cellphone of another dinner guest, was uploaded on Monday. Since then, it has been removed from video-sharing sites inside China, although it was still accessible on Weibo. It's unclear when the incident occurred, or what the relationsip was between the camera person and Bi. CCTV said it would investigate. "As a CCTV presenter, Bi Fujian's speech in the online video has led to grave social consequences," the network said in a statement posted on its Weibo account. CCTV did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Fondly known as "Grandpa Bi," the 56-year-old TV personality was born and grew up in the Mao era. The song Bi riffed on was part of a "red" Peking opera that was first performed in the late 1950s. It was popularized during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s -- which was launched by Mao -- when China was torn apart by violence and social unrest. The video quickly divided China's online community. Critics said Bi, as an influential public figure, deserved a harsh punishment. But others rushed to his defense, arguing that Bi was simply enjoying himself in a private setting and was set up by whoever uploaded the clip. The video also emerged just a day before the new head of CCTV started his job, leading some to wonder if it were a case of "a new broom sweeps clean." Mao still divides opinion in China. His giant portrait hangs on Beijing's Tiananmen Gate, and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital. But despite this reverence, Mao's is a deeply flawed legacy. Many remember him as a brutal dictator who inspired fear, paranoia and famine, and whose actions resulted in tens of millions of deaths. CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report.

A man vying to become the next Kentucky governor has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after a late local celebrity who bid five times for the title but never won enough votes. The 68-year-old Pulaski County resident, who was known as Terrill Wayne Newman until Tuesday, told the Lexington Herald-Leader he doesn't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will 'warm Galbraith's grave.' His predecessor, who died in 2012 from chronic emphysema, gained a following for his wit, sharp dress sense and support of legalizing marijuana. Terrill Wayne Newman (right), who is vying to become Governor of Kentucky, has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after the late local celebrity (left) who bid five times for the title but never won . The newly-christened Galbraith filed paperwork on Wednesday to run as an independent for the state's highest office. The Secretary of State's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by August 11 to get their names on the general election ballot. Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said. Galbraith says he and the late Galbraith were 'not friends per se,' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis. Dea Riley, who was the original Galbraith's running mate in 2011, said she thinks he would find the whole name change amusing. 'I can hear him now: "I'll tell the IRS to send him the tax bill,"' Riley said. But she also said the new Galbraith 'has very big shoes to fill' with his name and she hopes he will honor it. 'To have Gatewood's name and message prostituted, for the sake to garner political office, is a personal affront to me in that I was not only his running mate but equally his friend and confidant,' Riley said.

There looked to be so much bend on Leo Messi’s shot on the half hour at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night that if there had been no net to stop the ball it would kept on curling until it ended up back at the great man’s feet. The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted. Barcelona star duo Luis Suarez (right) and Lionel Messi embrace as Barcelona take a seven-point lead in La Liga . The Barcelona No 10 loses his markers in the Almeria penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike . Barcelona talisman Messi wheels away after opening the scoring  at the Nou Camp during a 4-0 victory over Almeria . Suarez followed Messi's lead by scoring a similar left-footed strike to double the Catalans lead with the first of his two goals . Barcelona defender Marc Bartra stuffs the ball under his shirt after netting a third with a headed goal on 75minutes . Barcelona (4-3-3): Bravo; Alves, Bartra, Mascherano, Adriano; Sergi Roberto, Xavi, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Pedro. Subs: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Mathieu, Pique, Iniesta, Rafinha, Neymar . Booked: Mascherano . Scorer: Messi 33', Suarez 55', Bartra 75', Suarez 90' Almeria (4-2-3-1): Julian; Ximo Navarro, Marin, Trujillo, Casado; Partey, Corona; Wellington Silva (Soriano), Espinosa (Mane), Edgar (Zongo); Bifouma. Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Julián Cuesta in the visitors’ goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Barça number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta’s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo’s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta’s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes.

Brazil full-back Dani Alves rushes to congratulate team-mate Messi after he gives Barcelona a first half lead . The Argentina phenomenon celebrates scoring his 33rd league goal of the season so far . Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria’s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona’s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury.

Sandra Garratt was in constant agony after undergoing two operations before her death . A grandmother racked with constant pain jumped from the top of a multi-storey car park to end her suffering, her devastated husband has said. Sandra Garratt, 56, went through two years of agony following two back operations for a slipped disc and not even morphine could dull the pain. Last month doctors told the housewife there was nothing more they could do ease her suffering and this was the 'final straw', according to her husband Steve. On Good Friday, the mother of two left her home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after telling her husband she was 'just popping out'. But he became anxious for her welfare and he called the police. At 2.35pm, police and ambulance crews were called to the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, where they discovered Mrs Garratt's body. She had fallen more than 50ft from the top of an Asda supermarket multi-storey car park. Mr Garratt, 57, told how he gave up his job as a community transport driver last year to care for his wife. He said her suffering had intensified in the last 18 months of her life and the pain had spread to her legs, feet and fingers. He added: 'She was in pain every minute of every day. She was a happy lovely person but withdrew from her happy family life. 'Before there had been hope but when there was nothing they could do, it was the final straw. 'Everybody says the same – she is now free from the pain. That's the only bit of comfort. 'The doctors and GPs, within the scope of the NHS waiting lists and everything that goes on, did everything they could.' Mrs Garratt leaves behind daughter Lucy, 37, son Jonathan, 26, and two grandchildren, Joshua and Jessica. The coroner has been informed of her death. Mrs Garratt told her husband she was 'popping out' on Good Friday. Hours later her body was found at the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, West Midlands .

A young Star Wars fan, who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies’ creator George Lucas asking whether he would allow Jedi Knights to marry in the future, was elated to receive a reply granting his request. Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric told Inside Edition: 'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy was on hand to film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son, who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It’s very black and white. There’s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don’t have emotions, but they do. It’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'

The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 at auction. The unique psychedelic cartoon, which is hand-painted, depicts the eponymous submarine from the 1968 film in which the Fab Four travel to Pepperland to save it from the Blue Meanies. The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas, Texas, on Thursday . The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the Yellow Submarine film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The 1968 film starred The Beatles (above) It features handwritten notes instructing artists on the correct colours to use when recreating the submarine. More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch £10,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time. Yellow Submarine was a success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album a year later . The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. The original cel is set to sell for £10,000 . 'It is a film that has stood the test of time and is as relevant today as when it was made in 1968. The Band Concert is the most expensive cel sold . The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported £280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference. 'It would be one of the earliest final versions of the Yellow Submarine hand-painted - it really is the holy grail of Yellow Submarine memorabilia. 'Since small stickers were used for when the sub travelled there are not really a great deal of Yellow Submarine cels out there. 'This comes from a former Yellow Submarine ink and paint department employee. 'It is an unusually large image. Colour model cels were used also to help determine the final approved colour scheme of the yellow submarine. 'Colour model cels from this film are very rare, and this is one of the single best cels of the Yellow Submarine we have seen.' The Animation Art Signature Auction will take place in Dallas, Texas on April 9.

A terminally-ill landlord whose dying wish was to marry his partner of 26 years saw their special day descend into farce after a series of blunders. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home. But, instead of having the magical day they had planned, the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly. Guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over, and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather, 54, after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple's special day (pictured) was full of blunders . Guests at the couple's (pictured) wedding were forced to listen to the song 'Wonderful Life' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on, rendering it invalid . Mr Haigh, who died weeks after the ceremony in November last year, was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he'd let her down. In fact, the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House in the city centre, where the pair said their vows. Mrs Haigh, 54, said: 'Geoff was heartbroken by it all. He kept apologising to me and saying he'd wished we'd got married years earlier and done it properly. 'He was devastated, as the way he saw it, this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness.' The couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once Mr Haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal. However, the landlord of The Ram's Head pub, in Oldham, was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely. The pair then settled upon the Manchester venue as it was not too far from their home. It took three people two hours to get Mr Haigh ready for his big day and, determined to make the day perfect for his bride-to-be, he battled through pain to make it to the venue. Mrs Haigh, 54, said every guest at the ceremony -  held in November last year in Manchester  -  wrote a letter of complaint. She has three marriage certificates (pictured) as the first two were riddled with errors . The couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony (pictured) and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date. An amended version posted later was full spelling errors . However, it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began. They said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down. Then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows, which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar. Mrs Haigh, a mother of three, said: 'There was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after I asked I was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day. Geoff Haigh and his wife Heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day. 'It felt like they were merely using us a practice go, like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them.' After the bride and groom said their vows, guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music 'Wonderful Life' while the registrar went out of the room. Unbelievably, almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before Mrs Haigh was compelled to take action. She said: 'Everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on. We couldn't believe it. 'It had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now.' After the ceremony, as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant San Carlos, the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate. They were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected, otherwise their marriage was invalid. Mrs Haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead. However, when the second certificate arrived in the post, it was addressed to Mrs Haigh in her maiden name 'Taylor' and included spelling errors on the document. A third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple. Mr Haigh (above) passed away in January this year, just weeks after his wedding to long-term partner Heather. The couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year . Mrs Haigh (left) said her new husband (right) was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down. She has received £137 from the Manchester register office following the calamity day . Mrs Haigh said: 'It felt like they didn't recognise we were married and that really hurt Geoff before he died. 'It made if feel like the whole thing didn't happen, like it meant nothing at all. It was devastating. 'The guests were all in tears for us. They were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously.' The newlyweds were offered a £137 refund but Mrs Haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough 'loss' to warrant compensation. She said: 'It wasn't about the money, but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband. 'It was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more. They said "we all make mistakes and we are only human". 'That's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man's dying wish and the most special day of our lives, that attitude is not acceptable.' The wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House (pictured)  in the city centre, where the pair said their vows . The family has since received an apology from Manchester City Council, which runs the register office based at Heron House. A spokesman said: 'I'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs Taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations. 'These types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious. They understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding.' However, tragically, Mr Haigh died on January 4 this year before receiving the apology. His wife added: 'Geoff was determined not to die over Christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come, and he didn't want that for us. The energy it took from him to hang on, I couldn't believe.'

Washington (CNN)This week is the 100th anniversary of what many historians acknowledge as the Armenian genocide -- the Turkish massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians . And it's also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word "genocide" to describe the atrocity. It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word "genocide" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a "genocide" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago . In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. "The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence," he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. "We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians . In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. "No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on," she wrote.

Jailed millionaire Robert Durst pleaded not guilty Tuesday to the newest charge against him - a federal charge of possessing a gun after a felony conviction. U.S. District Judge Lance Africk set a trial date for June 22. Durst is an estranged member of the wealthy family that operates 1 World Trade Center. He also faces a murder charge in California and two state weapons charges in Louisiana - one of possessing a .38-caliber revolver after a felony conviction and one of possessing the firearm along with an illegal drug: about 5 ounces of marijuana. Claiming innocence: Suspected murderer Robert Durst appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to a new charge of gun possession. Pictured above leaving federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana in handcuffs after the court appearance . Durst pleaded guilty to two federal charges in Pennsylvania in 2004: possessing a firearm while a fugitive and while under indictment. However, his lawyers say those convictions don't make it illegal for him to carry a gun under Louisiana law. The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of 55-year-old Susan Berman, a longtime friend -allegedly because she was going to talk to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. He was arrested early March 15, less than 12 hours before HBO aired the final segment of 'The Jinx,' in which - off camera in a bathroom but with the microphone still live - Durst whispers, 'There it is. You're caught!' After about 10 other short sentences and disjointed phrases, he says, 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' Durst was arrested last month on suspicion of the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. The two pictured together above . It's believed that Durst killed Berman because she was about to speak to investigators about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife Kathleen McCormack. Pictured together above . Tuesday's hearing had its own bizarre moment when prosecutor Mike McMahon asked Durst if he understood the maximum penalties he faced if convicted. Durst responded: 'And you are?' Durst's attorney and the judge then explained to him who McMahon was. Durst is being held without bail in a state prison where the Orleans Parish mental ward is located, because the sheriff's office says experts found him a suicide risk. Defense attorneys and prosecutors met with a different federal judge last week to discuss another federal matter: whether two FBI agents and a state trooper on an FBI task force should be held in contempt of court for failing to show up at a hearing last week before the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court magistrate. Federal prosecutors moved that part of the case to federal court Monday; Durst's attorneys have not filed their response and have said they would not comment until they do. Durst's lawyers say his arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the conclusion of 'The Jinx.' Durst had registered at the Marriott under the name Everette Ward and was lying low while HBO aired the final chapter of his life story. Authorities said they found a passport, a head-and-chest latex mask, a handgun and marijuana in his room. His lawyers say it was searched illegally.

A Montana judge who was censured by the state's high court for his comments about a 14-year-old rape victim has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that former state District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors. Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher. Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. At Rambold's August 2013 sentencing, Baugh said Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold, the Billings Gazette reported at the time. Baugh, per the newspaper, described the teenage girl as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth. Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. Scroll down for video . Selected: Former District Judge G. Todd Baugh has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. He sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that a 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher . Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence. Legal case: Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez (right) shared some responsibility for her rape by teacher Stacey Rambold (left) Baugh, who served almost 30 years as a state judge, stepped down last year after being censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days. He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he didn't know who nominated him for the achievement award. He also repeated his assertion that media reports about the rape case had not told the whole story. 'I'm not trying to say I didn't make any mistakes. If you go into all the mistakes that were made, it would give a better-balanced report,' Baugh said. Fehr said Baugh had been nominated for the award by members of the bar association, but she declined to say who that was or why he was chosen. Case: Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence . Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. Baugh later apologized for his remarks. He was also censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days . Marian Bradley, Northwest regional director for the National Organization for Women, said the award was inappropriate given Baugh's conduct on the bench. Regardless of his prior accomplishments, Bradley said the Rambold case cannot be overlooked. 'The last chapter in his career, he put himself out there and did not protect a young girl and did not protect a community,' Bradley said. 'Giving him a lifetime achievement award is going to send people into tailspins.' Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. In December, state District Judge Russell Fagg wrote in a column for the Billings Gazette that Baugh handled more than 30,000 cases in his career. 'He has made thousands of good calls, and a few bad calls, as have all of us,' Fagg wrote. 'Bottom line: Baugh is a wonderful person.'

Kelly Ripa has been grief stricken following the sad news that her friend, cosmetic surgeon Dr Fredric Brandt, was found dead by suicide at his Miami mansion on Sunday. So it's understandable that 44-year-old TV star was looking morose as she left her New York City apartment on Tuesday. The Live With Kelly & Michael co-host, who is usually seen smiling, wore a frown as she left the building alone. When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life.' Sad day: Kelly Ripa looked to be in mourning on Tuesday as she left her NYC apartment; on Sunday it was announced her surgeon friend Dr Fredric Brandt had died . The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice.' The former soap opera actress was dressed casually in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on. The beauty was carrying her coat as well as some papers, a cell phone and her purse. Casual look: The former soap opera actress was dressed down in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on . Feeling the pain: On her show Live With Kelly & Michael, the host told Michael Strahan that she will miss the doctor who had worked on the morning program . Near tears: When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life' Heartfelt: The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice' The day before the New Yorker tweeted her condolences for Dr Brandt, 65, who was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry.  Madonna and Stephanie Seymour were clients. 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer,' the star wrote. Her husband Mark Consuelos, retweeted choreographer Isaac Calpito's post, which read: 'Devastated over the loss of our dear friend @drfredricbrandt. You are missed. You are loved. The world has lost one of its kindest souls.' They were close: Dr  Brandt was remembered by  Ripa (left with the surgeon in 2011) in a tweet on Monday following his tragic suicide at his Miami home on Sunday . Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.' The City of Miami Police Department confirmed that Dr Brandt's death on Sunday was a suicide by hanging. An autopsy was scheduled on Monday, the coroner confirmed. Miami Herald columnist, Lesley Abravanel had said Brandt had been 'devastated' recently over rumors comparing him to a character on the Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Her note: The 44-year-old beauty's tweet said, 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer' Abravanel, a Miami Herald columnist, posted a series of tweets on Sunday claiming that he had been 'devastated' by unflattering comparisons to Dr Franff on the  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, according to  sources close to the doctor. The doctor's longtime publicist Jacquie Tractenberg told The New York Post on Monday: 'The show definitely deeply hurt him, he was being made fun of because of the way he looks. 'It is mean, and it was bullying. But the show was not the reason for his depression, and it was not the reason he would take his own life.' The Tractenberg & Co PR agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. Was he bullied?: Dr  Brandt (left) has a resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly 'devastated' by the portrayal . His colleague, Dr Robert Anolik, who worked with Brandt at his practice, posted a moving tribute on Monday. The acclaimed dermatologist wrote: 'Dr. Fredric Brandt died yesterday. For nearly 5 years, Fred and I worked side by side. He was far more than a colleague to me. He was a close friend. I will miss him every day.' The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami by his housekeeper where he lived alone. She called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. The New York Post also wrote a column last month comparing the real-life doctor to the fictional doctor on Tina Fey's hit comedy. 'Sources: Dr Fredric Brandt was "devastated" over comparisons to the protagonist on Tina Fey’s new Netflix show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt",' Abravanel tweeted. Behar tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed' An eye for art: Dr Brandt, a cosmetic dermatologist and well-known art collector pictured in front of a piece from his collection at his apartment in New York City on March 7, 2014 . Dr Franff only appears in one episode, titled 'Kimmy Goes To The Doctor!', of the first season. The character shares Dr Brandt’s smooth skin, platinum blond hair and enthusiasm for plastic surgery, but his door sign claims he’s a ‘board certified D, DS, DDSOBGYN’, rather than a cosmetic dermatologist. The Dr Franff character is depicted on the Netflix show with a high-pitched laugh and unable to speak certain words due to his plastic surgery. He is also seen drinking  from a surgical bag and reinflates his own face after being punched. Netflix had no comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy.

Moscow (CNN)A Russian TV channel aired Hillary Clinton's first campaign video with a rating stamp that means it's for mature audiences, because of fears it might run afoul of the country's anti-gay propaganda law. A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. "There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't," a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. "Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video)." Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, "I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about." The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that "gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights." Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as "a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia." Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. "I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them," Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). "We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone," he said before the 2014 Games. "That's why you can feel safe and free here," he added, "but please leave our children in peace." The rights group ILGA-Europe said in a May 2014 report that Russia was the worst place in Europe (out of 49 countries) for LGBTI people to live.

It was not immediately known who was driving or if the couple had worn seat belts. The top was down when the wreck occurred. Stauffer says there's evidence the vehicle started to skid at a slight left turn, then went off the road and hit an embankment near a barn. The vehicle had been rebuilt or restored, with new elements. 'There are no indicators of what caused the accident yet,' said Stauffer.

(CNN)A French-language global television network regained control of one of its 11 channels Thursday after a cyberattack a day earlier crippled its broadcasts and social media accounts. Television network TV5Monde was gradually regaining control of its channels and social media outlets after suffering what the network's director called an "extremely powerful cyberattack." In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. On a mobile site, which was still active, the network said it was "hacked by an Islamist group." ISIS logos and markings appeared on  TV5Monde social media accounts. But there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group. As day broke Thursday in Europe, the network had regained the use of one of its 11 channels and its Facebook page, Paul Germain, the chain's editor in chief, told BFMTV, a CNN affiliate in France. However, by late morning, a number of pages on the network's website had messages saying they were under maintenance. The outage began around 8:45 p.m. Paris time (2:45 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. TV5Monde offers round-the-clock entertainment and news programming that reaches 260 million homes worldwide, according to the Ministry of Culture and Communications. It functions under a partnership among the governments of France, Canada and Switzerland, as well as the Wallonia-Brussels Federation. Other networks that provide content to TV5Monde include CNN affiliates France 2 and France 3, France 24 and Radio France International.

'It was never meant to set off a debate on how to parent in the 21st century. 'I trust her enough to give her that little bit of independence as she continues to grow into a smart, beautiful young lady. 'We actually live very close to her school [and] I can just about see the school from my front porch without a drone.'

A singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner. Captured in a front room in Bahama, North Carolina, the three dogs – a Husky called Sky, a brown and white Springer Spaniel called Sadie and a black and white Springer Spaniel called Marshall – take their positions on their make-shift stage. Getting the tune underway, Sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on Sky’s ear as if whispering something – Sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction. The video begins with Sadie the Springer Spaniel barking and interacting with the Husky named Sky . The Springer Spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the Husky joins it, but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl. Following the Husky’s lead, the Spring Spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another. Meanwhile the other Springer Spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner. No, it's like this! The Husky begins howling, causing the Springer Spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead . All together now! The three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony . Before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl, which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo. The trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder. The howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs – who continue to wag their tails – showing any signs of letting up. No encore? The owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise . Eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying: ‘Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.’ And the three dogs, rather put out about being interrupted, stopping and turning to look at him in surprise.

Former Holland forward Dirk Kuyt is returning to Feyenoord next season, aiming to end his professional playing days at the club that was a launching pad for nine years at Liverpool and Fenerbahce, the Rotterdam club announced Friday. Kuyt signed a one-year contract with Feyenoord, who are currently third in the top-flight Eredivisie, but said his stay will likely be longer. Kuyt grew into a favorite among Feyenoord's fanatical fans during his first stint with the club from 2003-2006, after transferring from Utrecht. He was the Eredivisie's top scorer in the 2004-2005 season and was named Dutch footballer of the year in 2006. Dirk Kuyt (left) is returning to Feyenoord, nine years after leaving the Dutch Eredivsie club for Liverpool . Kuyt retired from international football in October after finishing third with the Netherlands at last year's World Cup - a tournament where he underscored his versatility by playing on the wing and at left back. He made 104 appearances for the Netherlands and scored 24 goals. He also was part of the team that finished second in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, losing to Spain in the final. The 34-year-old said now is a good time to return to Rotterdam as "I'm fit and have a great drive to make a success of my time at De Kuip," Feyenoord's stadium. Feyenoord director Martin van Geel said that although Kuyt signed only a one-year deal both he and the club intend his stay in Rotterdam to be longer. "Dirk can keep going for years," Van Geel said. "As far as he's concerned, he can become the Ryan Giggs of Feyenoord and we will add many more years. This will be music to the ears of all Feyenoord fans." The forward has had a successful career for Liverpool, Fenerbache and playing for his country .

While it might be the nation's largest grocer, Walmart Supercenter was ranked at the bottom of the barrel  in a recent survey of America's supermarkets. The retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in Consumer Reports' annual survey, and this year it was rated number 67, the second worst supermarket. As it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine, Walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce. However, it was noted for its better-than-average prices. Walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in Consumer Reports' annual supermarket survey . The retailer (above a worker in the produce section of a Walmart in Miama) came in at number 67 followed by chain Waldbaum's, which was in last place . 'Every store I go in has room to improve,' said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a statement that the company released to Consumer Reports. 'I can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better. 'And if we nail those, one store at a time, our short-term performance gets better.' The respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness, food quality, freshness and staff courtesy. Walmart was joined by A&P (rated number 66) and Waldbaum's (number 68), which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed, according to CBS. The annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts, which was cited by a quarter of respondents. Other findings included: . Source: Consumer Reports . America's favorite supermarket, taking first place, is New York-based Wegmans. The retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness, baked goods and overall shopping experience. Publix came in second place followed by Trader Joe's, Fareway Stores and Market Basket. Wegmans was also among a total of three grocers, including Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, that earned outstanding produce scores. 'It's going to sound cliché, but our employees are our secret sauce,' Jo Natale, Wegmans' vice president of media relations told Consumer Report. Natale also shed light on the fact that Wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded, which 'allows us to take a long-range view, invest in people, and grow at a controlled rate.' While only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely  satisfied with the quality of their store's produce, meat and poultry offerings; nationwide, Consumer Reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings. Findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including Wegmans, Publix, Costco, Whole Foods and Fresh Market were considered standouts in this category. So as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $5,400 on food, what makes a supermarket the best? The survey noted that those who were the 'freshest' stores were usually the best  overall. Wegmans (file photo above) was rated America's favorite supermarket followed by Publix, Trader Joe's and Fareway Stores . In the past, check out speed and low prices might have satisfied customers, but the survey said they are now also demanding a wider variety of healthy, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. They also want more organics and local produce. 'There's a growing rejection of overly processed and packaged foods, especially among younger consumers,' says Willard Bishop's Jim Hertel.

We take more photos of ourselves than ever - but it seems selfies are doing little for our self-confidence. Women typically take and delete five pictures before settling on a selfie they feel comfortable posting online, a survey found. And men are happy only on their fourth try. The new survey found women typically take and delete five pictures before they decide they like a selfie . UKIP leader Nigel Farage poses with some young voters while out canvasing in Broadstairs. The survey, carried out by OnePoll, found men are also guilty of taking multiple selfies before they post one they like . Two in three women (64 per cent) feel anxious just having their photo taken, while looking at snaps on social media made 41 per cent feel bad about themselves, according to a survey of 5,000 people by market researchers OnePoll. Of the children who were also questioned, which included 58 per cent who took selfies, 79 per cent said they were happy with the way they looked, 67 per cent thought they needed to look good. ITV's Good Morning Britain show, which commissioned the research, is encouraging viewers to share the first selfie they take on social media under the hashtag #SelfieEsteem. Jamelia, Nicky Byrne, Beth Tweddle, Richard Madeley, Piers Morgan, Nancy Dell’Olio, Rebecca Ferguson are among the celebrities backing the campaign. Piers Morgan appears on Good Morning Britain along with presenter Susanna Reid. The ITV show commissioned the survey and is encouraging viewers to share the first selfie they take on social media .

It also found 15 per cent of women and 19 per cent of men had cropped, filtered, or retouched pictures of their children.

A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, "Wow!"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.

(CNN)Thinking about presidential candidates?  Apparently, hormones are a major factor one should consider. According to one female businesswoman in Texas, Hillary Clinton shouldn't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she'll start an unnecessary war. When George W. Bush waged an unnecessary war in Iraq -- was his testosterone to blame? As Cheryl Rios, the CEO of Go Ape Marketing, sees it: "We're built differently, we have different hormones. In the world that we live in, I understand that there's equal rights and that's a wonderful thing and I support all of that. I don't support a woman being president." "With the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war," Rios wrote in a Facebook post. If Rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the Oval Office, she'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president. Throughout history, male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders' decision-making. Studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts. If science doesn't convince you, just Google "cheating politicians" for the long and sordid list of men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Sanford and John Edwards, whose hormones got the best of them. Rios has taken a lot of flak for her "biblically" inspired beliefs, but she's not the only one who's arguing that a woman's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern. Time magazine declared Hillary Clinton the "perfect" age to be president, because she's a postmenopausal woman who is "biologically primed" to lead. (She also happens to be a former first lady, senator and secretary of state.) I'm not joking. Believe me, I wish I were. No wonder Jon Stewart left "The Daily Show" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing. If discussions about a candidate's hormones are what we have to look forward to, the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed. But underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration: The bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015, a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias. We want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything. And you'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college, graduate school and the work force. But what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability, but a bias in how women and girls are viewed. Unfortunately, Cheryl Rios' view of women is not unique. Some people believe women have "our place" and that place is not at the table. They'll tell your daughter to "go for it" but believe she isn't qualified to fulfill her dreams. In a compelling series about women and work, Wharton School professor Adam Grant and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes. The evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless. It's overt: There are more men on corporate boards named John, Robert, William or James than there are women on boards altogether. The bias is also covert: When students rate their favorite professors, they describe the men as "geniuses" and the women as "nice." The bias is real, yet so many of us are blind to it. Hillary Clinton might not be the perfect candidate, but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the White House a much steeper climb. That's not just a problem for Democrats -- it's a problem for Republicans, Independents, everyone. The fact is, equality benefits everyone. It's better for the bottom line (companies with more women in leadership roles make more money).  It's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier, healthier, and more successful. It's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages.  And it's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results. Our nation, our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men. It's not enough to say to our daughters: "You can be anything you want to be." What we need to say is: "You can be anything you want to be, despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong." Rios said that if Clinton is elected, she is "moving to Canada" because "a female shouldn't be president."  Apparently Rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about Canada: Kim Campbell became the country's first female prime minister in 1993. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Canadians elected their first female prime minister, Kim Campbell.

Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after an evening in which their relegation into Sky Bet League One was marked by pre-match supporters' protests against Karl Oyston. Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation . Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen. 'We got off to a flyer and having got back to 1-1 I'm a little bit disappointed we didn't take anything on a horrible night on a horrible pitch.'

Real Madrid have 48 hours to make a decision on Javier Hernandez as the clock runs down on their first option to buy the Manchester United striker. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Monday that the European champions would take stock of Hernandez's situation at the end of the season. However, under the terms set out by United when they loaned the 26-year-old to Madrid, Thursday April 30 marks the end of the Spanish club's 'exclusivity period' to buy the player. Javier Hernandez is enjoying a fine run of form at Real Madrid - scoring three times in his last two games . Hernandez (centre) returned to training with his Real Madrid team-mates on Tuesday . Hernandez (second left) was all smiles in training, but the 26-year-old faces an uncertain future . From Friday they will no longer have first option and United will field offers of around £10million from West Ham, Southampton and Lazio. The Mexico striker who has scored three goals in his last two games has one year left on contract at Old Trafford, but his latest displays have boosted his valuation. Ancelotti said: 'It is a subject that we will evaluate at the end of the season. What I can say is that I have liked his professionalism during the whole year. He is enjoying his opportunity a lot, he has a high level of professionalism and for a coach to have these type of players that are always ready is very positive.'

(CNN)People magazine has anointed Sandra Bullock the world's most beautiful woman of 2015, the publication revealed on Wednesday. Bullock, 50, joins a long line of actresses to receive the honor, including last year's cover girl, Lupita Nyong'o, and Gwyneth Paltrow in 2013. She seems to be taking it all in stride, calling the whole thing "ridiculous." "Real beauty is quiet. Especially in this town, it's just so hard not to say, 'Oh, I need to look like that,' " she told People. "No, be a good person; be a good mom; do a good job with the lunch; let someone cut in front of you who looks like they're in a bigger hurry. The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying." The cover story focuses on Bullock's home life with her son, Louis, 5, and her efforts to stay healthy and fit past her 40s. "I was putting him to bed and told him that even when I'm old and gray and more wrinkly than I am now, I'll still love him and want to tuck him in," she said. "And he asked why I have wrinkles, and I said, 'Well, I hope some of them are from laughing so much.' And he touched my face and said, 'You're not old, you're just happy.' " The Oscar-winning star of movies including "Gravity," "The Blind Side" and "Crash" said she's happy with who she is. "As long as I'm healthy and strong and I don't let this mind of mine run amok with insecurities about what I am not, I can look in the mirror and like who I see." The selection of Bullock, the oldest woman to receive top honors in the history of the list, is a sign that beauty knows no age, say some. "Great choice! Gorgeous, talented, over 50 and FABULOUS! That's the way it's done!" wrote one fan on People's Facebook page. Also making the "most beautiful" cut this year: Gabrielle Union, Ariana Grande and Laverne Cox. The issue hits newsstands Friday.

The First Family has kicked off this year's Easter celebrations on Sunday with a visit to the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia. Rev Howard-John Wesley had opened the service by welcoming the president, before urging the congregation not to take selfies with him. 'How fitting that on the day we celebrate the rising of our Lord and savior, we also welcome our sitting president,' Wesley said, as the congregation rose to their feet in applause. 'This is not selfie time,' Wesley said jokingly. 'Let the brother worship in the house of God.' Churchgoers traditionally walk around to shake hands and give hugs during the greetings and announcements portion of service, but the pastor encouraged the crowd to stay in their seats and greet only their closest neighbors, as the sanctuary was tightly secured with Secret Service agents. The choir - including women in purple dresses and men sporting purple ties - sang a lively rendition of the hymn 'He Lives,' stirring most of the church, filled to capacity, to clap, sing and sway in praise alongside the upbeat organ keys while ushers collected the tithes and offering.

Jane Tipper had been walking her dog Molly when the eight-year-old chased a lamb over a cliff . A Border Terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall after chasing a spring lamb off the edge of  a cliff before spending three days stranded on a remote beach. Dog Molly had been on a walk with owner Jane Tipper and her daughter Hannah in Eype, Dorset, last week when the she fell over the cliff's edge along with the lamb. Molly survived a vertical drop of 100ft then rolled 150ft down a steep slope and coming to rest in gorse near the bottom. Her distraught owners managed to see that the eight-year-old had survived the drop, but had no way of getting down to the beach to get her. A team of ten coastguards arrived on the scene and a winchman was lowered down the cliff face but was unable to find her despite four hours of searching. Ms Tipper, who had been celebrating her 64th birthday, was forced to return home in nearby Charmouth without her beloved dog which she has had since she was a puppy. She contacted the website DogLost which arranged for missing posters to be put up in the area. Three days later, Molly was found in an exhaustive state after walking a mile further along the beach to an area popular with dog walkers. It is unclear what had happened, but luckily, she has come through her ordeal relatively unscathed - but there has been no sign of the lamb since the incident. Ms Tipper said: 'I was with my daughter, it was my birthday and we planned a short walk and lunch in a local cafe but we never got there. The border terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall, including a 100ft vertical drop, in Eype, Dorset, but her owner had no way of reaching her. Coastguards searched thoroughly but were unable to find her . 'Molly's usually very good, she doesn't chase animals. 'She fell about 200ft but the cliff was on a slight slope. I couldn't see her at the bottom but my daughter did so we knew she survived the drop. 'The coastguard winched one of them over the cliff and he went from side to side looking for her but couldn't see her. 'It's rocky there, there's thick patches of gorse and it's extremely dangerous. 'After a couple of hours they said they just couldn't spot her. They were very upset about it.' She added the incident left her 'completely numb'. 'We didn't stop searching at the end of the day,' she said. 'When I got home I phoned as many people as I could think of.' But fortunately, a female dog walker recognised Molly from the lost posters that had been put up in the area on Friday. After Ms Tipper put up missing dog posters, Molly was identified by a dog walker three days after going missing. Pictured right, the cliff face in Dorset where Molly fell . Ms Tipper added: 'The lady was walking her dogs when Molly followed her and sat next to her. She called me and we met up and fortunately it was Molly, I was worried it was going to be someone else's dog. 'Molly was very pleased to see me, especially when I got a gravy bone out of my pocket. 'She wasn't hurt or limping or anything, but she was shattered and spent the rest of the day asleep when we got home. 'I think it's really knocked the stuffing out of her. ' A coastguard spokesman urged dog owners to always keep their pets on lead while walking near the coast.

A video showing a man cracking a giant egg to reveal another fully formed egg inside, may be enough to scramble your brain. YouTube user Elman511 cracked open the over-sized egg that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ While the instance is extremely rare, it’s caused when the hen is in the process of forming an egg in her oviduct and another oocyte – the ovum or egg cell that becomes the yolk of the egg – is released too soon. Scroll down for video . Egg-traordinary: US YouTube user Elman511 cracked open an over-sized egg (shown on the left) that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ In the video, Elman511 cracks the egg, which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. He then cracks the smaller egg, which also has a yolk and white inside. ‘That’s the end of the nesting dolls of egg…an egg inside of an egg… crazy man,’ he said, before noting that the yolks look rich. Egg-citing: In the video, ‘Elman511’ cracks the egg (pictured), which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. The unusual occurrence is down to a counter-peristalsis contraction . This is when a second oocyte (yolk) is released by the hen's ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The unusual occurrence is called a counter-peristalsis contraction. A hen releases an oocyte from her left ovary into her oviduct every 18 to 26 hours, Back Yard Poultry Mag explained. Usually, the oocyte travels down the oviduct, adding layers of the egg until it’s laid through the hen’s vent. But in a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The phenomenon has been mentioned as far back as 1250 AD by the Dominican friar and polymath Albertus Magnus in his book De Animalibus. Ask the egg-spert: In a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. This results in an egg with another made inside it, producing two yolks (pictured)

(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for "lost" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the "holiday" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the "mistake" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the "war on women" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious "war on women" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The "war on women" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the "war on women" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative "solution" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.

Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge . A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman . 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'

An investigation has concluded Freddie Gray broke his neck after falling head-first into the back of the police van as it was moving, it was reported today. Medical and law enforcement sources briefed on the police investigation told ABC News Gray's 'catastrophic' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt 'in the back door of the van'. They claimed there was 'no evidence' Gray sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest, which was caught on camera on a street side on April 12. According to ABC's sources, Gray was standing in the van, bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door. It is believed he fell into the door, breaking his neck. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A report claims Freddie Gray broke his neck when he fell head-first into the back of the van as it was moving . Similar van: Freddie Gray was stood, bent over, with his head facing the back door of a van like this . Timeline? It is believed Gray fell head-first into the back of the van, breaking his neck, during the journey . Inside: The above diagram shows the inside the police van . Pictured: The second stop which police failed to report in their paperwork after the van journey, during which Freddie Gray sustained a 'catastrophic' head injury. It was picked up by a privately-owned security camera . According to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray . The news comes hours after Baltimore Police admitted the van transporting Gray made a previously unreported stop. The mysterious detail was picked up by a privately-owned security camera, and will be integral to the police investigation into Gray's death, which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on Thursday morning. It is not known why the van stopped at the corner of North Fremont Ave and Mosher Street before it made another two stops then finally transported Gray to the hospital. And police have yet to clarify why Gray would have been standing without a seat belt on. Just nine days before his arrest, the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy, making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van. Revelation: Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop. He refused to elaborate on the details of the new information . Police Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to elaborate on the new information. He said the contents of the report, which was completed and handed to the State Attorney at 8.50am Thursday, will remain confidential as they continue to investigate. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested. The report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver, who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators, according to ABC. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton. As the police department, Mayor's office, and state prosecutors refuse to address the development, it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of Gray's arrest more than two weeks ago. A relative of one of the suspended police officers told CNN she believes Gray was injured during his arrest outside the van. Her family member, she said, was based inside the van, and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he 'didn't do'. However, this theory is at odds with the medical examiner's report which allegedly found Gray sustained injuries by falling over inside the van, where he had been placed without a seat belt. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN her family member was in the van with Gray as he screamed and cried for medical help. But she believes the spinal injury which led to Gray's death was inflicted earlier, during his arrest on April 12. In an appeal that echoes Gray's family, she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow. 'Six officers did not injure this man,' she told Don Lemon. Secret stop: This is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stop . These are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stop . Jung Hwang's convenience store's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting Freddie Gray . 'Six officers didn't put him in the hospital. 'I'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did, that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.' Her words came after a police document was leaked to the Washington Post, in which the other prisoner in the transport van with Gray said he could hear the 25-year-old slamming himself against the wall. The prisoner speculated that Gray was trying to hurt himself. In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'. However, he admits he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton . The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family. 'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we've seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' Outrage over the unexplained death of a black man in Baltimore, Maryland prompted nationwide protests against police brutality on Wednesday from Houston to Boston. Baltimore has been the scene of near-nightly protests ever since the April 19 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who is believed to have been fatally injured while in police custody. State Attorney Marilyn Mosby urged the public to be patient as she reviews the information. 'While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,' Mosby said on Thursday. 'We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.' Freddie Gray: The 25-year-old was poisoned by lead paint as a child growing up in Baltimore . Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west side . Nicknamed 'Pepper', he was described by an ex-girlfriend as happy-go-lucky with an infectious sense of humor. The Baltimore police knew him, however, as a 5ft-8ins felon who had notched up at least 18 arrests and a handful of convictions - mainly for Class A drugs but also burglary, assault and illegal gambling. He was said to have set off running at the sight of police patrolling a well known open-air drug market. He was taken into custody for possession of a switchblade and during transport to the station he experienced what officers described as 'a medical emergency'. Gray, who had asthma, requested an inhaler and had trouble breathing in the van, but police didn't provide his inhaler. According to Gray's family his spine was severed 80 per cent at his neck, three vertebrae were fractured and his larynx was injured. Court papers describe Gray's childhood as problematic. He lived with his heroin-addicted disabled mother in a home in Sandtown-Winchester that contained enough poisonous lead in the peeling painted walls and windowsills for a court settlement to conclude that he and his two sisters were incapable of leading normal functioning lives. Lab tests conducted in the 1990s showed that they had levels of lead in their blood nearly double what the state of Maryland defines as the minimum for lead poisoning. In Baltimore, more than 2,600 children have been found to have high levels of lead in their blood, according an annual report released by the Maryland Department of the Environment in 2014. 'This is the toxic legacy of lead-based paint,” Ruth Ann Norton, head of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative and a founding member of the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission, told the Baltimore Sun. 'Our kids are ill equipped to stay in the classroom, finish school. They’re very unlikely to go on to higher education. They’re less likely to be able to hold a job', she said. 'They’re less equipped to be able to overcome the poverty and other circumstances that pull them down. Children with lead poisoning will have defects, regardless of whether their parents are ‘nice’ or not.' Gray lived off the resulting 'lead check' settlement although it is unclear exactly how much he received. Whatever money he did have he was said to spend buying designer accessories. The Sandtown neighborhood is a 72-block neighborhood made up of almost entirely of African Americans. More than one-third of residents live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter are unemployed. The majority of Maryland's state prison population are said to said to hail from Sandtown, according to the Justice Policy Institute.

Speaking to The Daily Mail, Sir Stirling said he sees fitness as a 'way of life' which is why he is still so confident behind the wheel. However, never one for strenuous gym sessions, he puts his health down to more unusual methods. He said: 'I have half a bottle of wine a day, which fits in very nicely, and that's it. I do what I call lady press ups and I do 77 a day. 'It's not as difficult as it sounds because I do them from a kneeling position. I could not do 70 press ups like I could when I was 30 years old. 'I've broken various bones during my career so I'm not that flexible. I think staying fit is a way of life more than anything else really.' When it comes to diet, he said he believes in indulgence and never denies himself something he wants. He said: 'I never go to bed hungry, let's put it that way, especially as Susie is such a fantastic cook. Car SOS sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. Above, Sir Stirling with presenters Fuzz Townshend and Tim Shaw . Sir Stirling drove the refurbished car in 1962 - one month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career (pictured above). He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks . 'I allow myself whatever I want but I would have to say my indulgences are that Susie and I drink one bottle of wine each day, white certainly, Chardonnay. And chocolate. I'm trying to cut that down but not that successfully.' He made the revelations after a new documentary reunited the father-of-two with the Austin-Healey Sprite he used as a training car before the 1962 Sebring three-hour race. The race took place a month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career. He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks. He returned to the cockpit a year later but decided against competing professionally as he felt he was no longer driving instinctively. The Austin-Healey Sprite was also used by the rest of his team, including Hollywood star Steve McQueen and racing legends Innes Ireland and Pedro Rodriguez. Car SOS, which broadcasts on the National Geographic Channel on Thursday, sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. While he found fame hurtling around corners at death-defying speeds, Sir Stirling now takes a more measured approach to the road. For the last 18 months he has been driving a Renault Twizy, an electric car with a top speed of 50mph. He said of the car, which retails for less than £7,000: 'I live right in the middle of London, right by Hyde Park Corner, and the limitations on an electric car like that, you don't notice them. 'If I lived outside the North Circular there might be times when I'd think "Crickey, I wonder if I'll make it back on the charge" but having said that, the Twizy is just the sort of car to have around London. Sir Stirling has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. Above, the couple at Silverstone in July 2011 . 'It is absolutely very different to the cars I used to drive. There are certainly good reasons to have a petrol car but living where I do, in the centre of London, I can't think of anything better than what I have got.' Sir Stirling, who was knighted in 2000, said he would not want to be a professional driver today because he thinks there are too few races. He said: 'It's quite different now though, they only do 18 races a year, I was doing 52 because I would go down to Australasia in the winter or Malaysia or South Africa and do all types of racing. ' It's so different now that you can't compare the life of a driver then and now. It's unfortunately one of those things that has moved on and I don't think will ever be able to move back.' He has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. He added: 'If your wife is your best friend that's the important thing to me. If every decision you think about or make or take you discuss with her first, I think that's very important. 'But then Susie says I do what I want anyway.' Car S.O.S. broadcasts on Thursday April 9 at 8pm on National Geographic Channel.

The police officer accused of murdering Walter Scott will be banned from seeing his first-born child for several months, it was revealed today. Patrol officer Michael Slager will be refused the right to hold the baby which his wife Jamie is set to give birth to in a few weeks. He is only granted video access to his eight and a half month's pregnant wife and an officer stands outside the booth whenever he talks to his family. They are not allowed to spend any time together and contact is via video screens with headphones at the Charleston County jail. But the baby will not be able to enter the South Carolina prison. Before the fall: Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, with his wife Jamie before his arrest. Slager was charged with murder after shooting Walter Scott, 50, after stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina . Visit: Michael Slager received a visit at Charleston County Jail last Friday from his pregnant wife and mom . It is deemed unsafe for an infant to enter the prison so Slager will have to rely on photographs as cell phones and access to the internet is forbidden. He will be informed by a telephone call and have to wait to see photographs, which will be examined by officials before being presented to him. When Jamie attended the jail on Friday, she was made to turn through the prison's reception area and take a seat next to a video screen for a talk with him which lasted around two hours. The booths are protected by screens to prevent onlookers from seeing inmates, but appointments have to made in advance. Relatives of other prisoners queued to use the video booths after registering with prison officials behind thick glass security screens as Jamie and her accused husband talked with the aid of headphones. But their first child together will not be allowed to visit him in prison until jail chiefs decide that the baby's health would not be at risk from being there. Although there is no specific age limit, prison policy is not to allow babies in. No date has yet been set for his first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away. Major Eric Watson of the Charleston County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online: 'He is treated just like any other prisoner, except for being in protective custody. 'His baby won't be coming to the prison and he will not be allowed to see the child. It could be several months before he does. 'His attorney can apply for the baby to be brought to the jail if he wants.' Walter Scott was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen. Family tell says the light was an accessory and both mandatory stop lamps were functioning . Slager, 33, already has two step children from his wife's previous marriage, but the new baby will be the first for him and Jamie. Major Watson said Slager had no access to the internet and was under close scrutiny to deter any threat from angry prisoners over the shooting of Walter,who was gunned down by the officer after being stopped for an apparent faulty tail light on his Mercedes. Walter's supporters and family say he was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen and this was wrong because the light was an accessory and both his obligatory stop lamps were functioning. Major Watson said Slager was being offered three meals a day and recreation time, but was isolated from other inmates. Housed in a room with one small window, he has no interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail. One released prisoner said outside the gates: 'Man, it ain't no holiday being in there. He has to watch his back more than most because of what he did. There's a lot of angry men in there, black and white.' Walter's brother Anthony said police faced 'many questions' about traffic stops based on racial profiling and that his brother's death should serve as a catalyst for a change in police policies. Meanwhile, the man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton. No date has yet been set for Slager's first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away . The mystery man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton . The 30-year-old was detained by police as Walter fled his Mercedes Benz before dying in a hail of bullets and later released. Pierre's family said they had no idea why he was in the car and how he came to be friends with the shooting victim. His grand mother Eunice Fulton, 70, said: 'I spoke with my daughter Franetta on Thursday and Pierre had only just told her he was in the car. 'It was a terrible incident but we haven't had the chance to speak to him about it. He used to live with me until a couple of years ago. But I don't where he hangs out now. He moves around.' Pierre, who was known to police, had stayed in the background since Walter was shot by officer Michael Slager and at the weekend rejected media requests for interviews. He has given a full statement to investigators, but police refused to reveal his name and what he has told them. He had requested privacy. Pierre was caught on the policeman's dash cam after Walter had fled and been shot. But police released him without charge and he was not suspected of any crime. He has convictions for unlawfully carrying a pistol and served 174 days in prison in 2005 and has been arrested several times. His grandmother added: 'He is a good grandson. He cares for his family. But I don't know what he is doing now.' Pierre has worked as a cleaner, laundry man and warehouseman over the years, but some members of his family have lost touch with him. Rosanne Grant of Alternative Staffing employment agency told Daily Mail Online: ' He worked at various jobs over the period of a year through me. The last time I hear about him was in 2006 and nothing since. I don't know what he has been working at.'

The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was ‘no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident’. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had ‘existed for some time prior to the accident’. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell’s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.’

Sunderland are trailing former Wigan striker Franco di Santo. The Argentine is playing for Werder Bremen and has scored 13 goals in 22 games this season. The Bundesliga side want £8million for the 26-year-old who Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton knows well from his time at Chelsea. Sunderland are considering a summer move for in-form Werder Bremen forward Franco Di Santo . The Argentine has been in superb form for his club this season, netting 13 goals in 22 games . Di Santo began his senior career with Chilean side Audax Italiano in 2006, before catching the Blues' eye two years later. However, he failed to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and following a similarly ineffectual loan spell at Blackburn Rovers, was sold to Wigan in 2010. He spent three seasons with the Lancashire-based outfit, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances. Di Santo was an unused substitute during the club's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2013, before being released at the end of that season. He made the move to the Bundesliga in August 2013 and has appeared to fulfil some of his early promise. Di Santo previously played for Chelsea but struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and was sold . Di Santo played for Wigan for three seasons, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances before being released .

(CNN)Roseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: "My vision is closing in now," she said. "I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up." Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making . Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) "It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of," explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. "Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision," Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy . Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk . Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . Eat your greens . Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries . Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke . While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.

Eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements, a study has claimed. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.

A sports journalist has outraged social media users after publishing 'inappropriate' and 'despicable' tweets in which he condemned the commemoration of Anzac Day, mocked the Digger's bravery and accused them of committing war crimes. The comments from SBS football reporter and presenter Scott McIntyre incited a hashtag that called for him to be sacked, and even caught the disapproving attention of Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull, after tweeting them on the day of the centenary services. 'The cultification of an imperialist invasion of a foreign nation that Australia had no quarrel with is against all ideals of modern society,' McIntyre tweeted on Saturday evening, referring to the Anzac's landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey.

Jessica Silva has spoken about why she had to kill her abusive husband and revealed she hopes his family can one day forgive her for what she did. In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' On Sunday night, Jessica Silva speaks publicly for the first time about the day, Mother’s Day 2012, when she stabbed and killed her partner, the father of her young son. Last month she walked free from court, despite being convicted of manslaughter, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all. Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica’s parents). He revealed to Michael Usher that the ordeal had so destroyed Jessica that 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I didn't recognise her' Jessica Silva admits she was living in fear and violence and she told no one. 'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' 'During the interview she gets to the point where she reveals "my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness". 'I don't know if there will ever be a neat ending. 'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, "you're fat, you're ugly", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . 'On that fateful night, Jessica made a split-second decision to save herself and her family,' according to the 60 Minutes program. 'Jessica opens up about her life with Polkinghorne and recounts what happened the night that ended in his death.' 'I didn't realise that she was going to be as raw as she still was,' Usher added. 'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how "I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.' See the full story on 60 Minutes at 8.30pm on Nine tonight .

(CNN)A 32-year-old Massachusetts man is facing murder charges, authorities said Wednesday, four days after another man's remains were found in a duffel bag. The Middlesex District Attorney's Office said that Carlos Colina, 32, will be arraigned the morning of April 14 for murder in connection with the remains discovered Saturday in Cambridge. Earlier this week, Colina was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. A Middlesex County judge then revoked bail for Colina in another case he's involved in, for alleged assault and battery. The victim in that case is different from the one whose remains were found in recent days. Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. "This was a gruesome discovery," District Attorney Marian Ryan said. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.

Fired: Major General James Post III was fired on Friday after making a treason comment . An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane. A-10 retirement: The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the A-10,  low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support . The inspector general's investigation interviewed several witnesses who remembered Post using the word 'treason' to describe efforts to oppose the Air Force leadership's decision to retire the plane, either via a social media campaign or by talking to Congress. In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.' General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander. Post issued an apology on Friday and said he did not intend to try to prevent people from talking to lawmakers. Handed in a latter: General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander .

Ukip candidate Kim Rose (pictured handing out sausage rolls today) is being investigated by police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls . A Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event, which also saw veteran snooker player White play pool with local youngsters. Mr Rose, a jeweller, said he was oblivious until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. Laughing off the allegations, he said: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes. 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties. 'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 'He said, "it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.' Mr Rose, who will now have to report to a police station on Monday, added: 'It was a fantastic day. We laid on teas, coffees, sandwiches and some sausage rolls. 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.' Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right) branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll' Today Mr Rose was seen out in Southampton handing out sausage rolls to members of the public . He said: 'The Ukip support is very strong here and I feel the main political parties will do anything they can to scrutinise everything about us.' Mr Rose added that if other politicians fear voters could be 'bribed with sausage rolls', perhaps it is not surprising they will not trust the country with a referendum on EU membership. Today the parliamentary candidate was out campaigning on the streets of Southampton, handing out sausage rolls to members of the public. Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, backing Mr Rose. He said: 'I think it’s utter nonsense. There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions. 'Having a few sausage rolls I don’t really think counts as one of those.' Mr Rose said the event, which was attended by 250 people, took place at a community centre in Southampton on February 21 - more than a month before Parliament was officially dissolved. He invited veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, who he described as a long-time friend. The former world number two and six-time World Champion, nicknamed 'The Whirlwind', played pool with residents, who were charged £2 to attend the event. 'I've known Jimmy as a friend for a number of years and so I asked him to come down and play pool with the kids,' Mr Rose said. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. 'I didn't want to make the event very Ukip so we put all the party banners away and everybody had a game of pool with Jimmy.' The Electoral Commission said the pastry provision was a police matter. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We have a received an allegation of "treating" by a prospective parliamentary candidate, contrary to the Representation of the People Act 1983. We are looking into the complaint. No arrests have been made.' Electoral Commission rules on treating state: 'A person is guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting. 'Treating requires a corrupt intent - it does not apply to ordinary hospitality.' Anyone found guilty of treating can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. Mr Rose has been a member of Ukip since 1999. He briefly stood as an independent in the key marginal Southampton Itchen seat in 2010 before pulling out. He is campaigning on tackling deprivation in Southampton, as well as wanting to pull the UK out of the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron came under criticism in the constituency earlier this week after sending a letter to residents spelling the constituency's name wrong three times. His letter, which has his letterhead and signature, had 'Itchen' spelled as 'Itchin', prompting the Conservatives to apologise for the embarrassing mistake. The constituency's MP has been Labour's John Denham since 1992. He held the seat in 2010 by just 192 votes and is standing down after May 7.

A husband was left so traumatised by his wife's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock, despite his wife already being given a hefty payout. In a case which could have huge financial consequences for the NHS, Julie Ronayne was awarded £160,000 after she was left 'looking like Michelin man' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008. Her husband Edward, who lives with Mrs Ronayne in Netherley, Liverpool, was awarded £9,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife's appearance. Edward Ronayne was given £9,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up 'like Michelin man' after botched surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital (pictured) The severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis, which the woman had contracted during the surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation. The test case, being heard at London's Appeal Court, could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an NHS mishap. Mr Ronayne was awarded the damages from Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust in July 2013. Liverpool County Court heard how he had been a 'secondary victim' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife's new appearance. He had described her 'colloquially as looking like a Michelin man', the court heard. Mr Ronayne also described his wife's first two days in hospital as 'the worst days of my entire life'. He said he had been 'brought up not to complain' but had never fully recovered from the sight. He added that he had been left feeling tearful, overwhelmed, angry and powerless. The judge, who described him as 'an honest and reliable witness', said: 'His symptoms...were pathological and went beyond simply the distress and anger that a man would suffer due to the near terminal illness of his wife.' But in the appeal court today, Charles Cory-Wright QC, who represents the health trust, told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury. He said Mr Ronayne's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims, costing the cash-strapped NHS millions in compensation. The barrister argued that Mr Ronayne would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation. He added that he was visiting his wife in hospital and therefore would have expected her to look unwell. He told the court: 'Hospitals on a day-to-day basis deal with people who are ill or vulnerable. They go there followed by their loved ones. It is unfortunately a matter of day-to-day occurrence that great emotional responses will take place in a hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if Mr Ronayne is allowed to keep the money. The test case is being heard at the appeal court . 'The question arises more and more often in cases like this as to whether those relatives have a claim.' Stressing the importance of the appeal, he told the judges: 'This appeal is not just about this case, but the concerns NHS Trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place. Peritonitis is caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the stomach. It is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, which can rapidly spread around the body. Peritonitis requires immediate treatment and is a medical emergency. Most cases of peritonitis are the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix or digestive disorders. Peritonitis can be fatal and needs to be treated quickly to avoid such complications. Source: NHS . 'The effect of this judgement, if it stands, is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases, as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock. 'Often emotional illness follows, but there is not the necessary element of shock. There needs to be a suddenly shocking event which, because of its shocking nature, causes that psychiatric illness. That is often lost in the wash in these cases.' But Lord Justice Sullivan said the incident had no doubt been 'shocking' 'Simply going into hospital and seeing one's loved ones and family looking peaky is not enough,' he said. 'But to see one's wife looking like the Michelin man is shocking.' Mr Cory-Wright then replied: 'If you saw your loved one looking like the Michelin man, swollen and all that, it would be shocking in an ordinary sense. 'But it would not be shocking in the sense of being suddenly overwhelmed so as to lead to psychiatric injury.' The judges recognised the importance of the case by reserving their decision on the trust's appeal until a later date. The case was heard in front of Lord Justice Sullivan, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Beatson. Mrs Ronayne went on to make a good recovery.

John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United with thousands of supporters planning to boycott Sunday's home match against Spurs. The 50-year-old has found himself the target of angry fans who are disillusioned with Mike Ashley’s running of the club. Results on the pitch – they have lost five on the spin - have not helped Carver’s cause, but the problems at Newcastle run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad. John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United . United’s supporters will protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from billionaire Ashley, especially as the Magpies have returned record profits of £18.7million and this week revealed they also have £34m sat in a bank account. Carver is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer – or deflect – questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis, distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul. But as reported by Sportsmail last month, senior sources within St James’ Park have indicated that Derby boss Steve McClaren will take over in the summer, regardless of whether or not the Rams are promoted from the Championship. On Tyneside, however, he will inherit what Carver believes is the toughest task in the land: ‘I think it is the hardest job in football, definitely,’ he said. Steve McClaren has already been tipped as a replacement for Carver should he face the Newcastle axe . ‘For me, this is the dream job, but you love it and hate it at the same time. ‘The hardest thing is taking the criticism off your own people. Some of it is deserved and some of it is not. ‘Sometimes you’re dealt the hand and you’ve got to get on with it and this is the hand I’ve been dealt. ‘When I took it on, if I hadn’t accepted then I would have been kicking myself. ‘And I’ve said this before, I genuinely believe that if I’ve got the right tools I can do the job. ‘But it is bitter sweet at the moment. This job is definitely a rollercoaster.’ Website AshleyOut.com are co-ordinating Sunday's planned boycott. They will protest outside of the Gallowgate End before kick-off and after the game. During the match they will go to Leazes Park behind the stadium. Carver, though, has urged fans to get behind the team. Fans are unhappy at how Newcastle are being run under Mike Ashley and have planned a boycott . ‘I would go to the match because I support the team,’ said Carver when asked if he would stay away as a supporter. ‘I think they (boycotters) do support the team but they have obviously got their own issues. I respect those issues. ‘I never thought I'd see this to be perfectly honest, especially in the North East of England because we love football. ‘So obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come, and I respect that.’ Carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against Tottenham Hotspur .

This is the moment when a not-so-little baby elephant seal emerged from the sea to give a surprised tourist one big cuddle. Charlene Fritz, 35, was visiting  Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula as part of an expedition when she made an unusual friend on the beach. Despite being no more than two months old, the elephant seal pup is still thought to have weighed around 200lbs, and Ms Fritz had a struggle sitting upright. Scroll down for video . One big cuddle: The elephant seal is thought to have been no more than two months old, but at a whopping 200lbs, Canadian tourist Charlene Fritz still struggled to reciprocate the hug . Making friends: Ms Fritz had the surprise of a lifetime when the baby elephant seal came out of the water for a cuddle during an expedition to Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula . Will you be my mummy? Elephant seal pups are abandoned by their mothers at just one month to learn how to take care of themselves . Charlene, from Saskatchewan, Canada, said: 'The seal climbed on top of me without hesitation. We shared a very sweet moment in time I will never forget. 'Her mouth was all pink inside and her eyes were amazing to look into. Like the deepest depths of the sea. I could have stared into her eyes forever.' She added: 'It was made very clear to me that I was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her. 'She came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up. I wanted to hug her so badly. 'Physically she felt like a big dough ball, super warm and like she had no bones. She did not smell of fish or have bad breath. She had never even eaten a fish at that point in her life. Rules: Ms Fritz explains that she badly wanted to hug the baby seal, but that regulations on the Antarctic expedition dictated that she in no way touch the pup . 'Sweet moment in time': Ms Fritz described the seal pup's eyes as being 'like the deepest depths of the sea' Crushing: Ms Fritz struggles to sit upright under the weight of the 200lbs baby elephant seal . Two young elephant selas have a rest on the shore of Snow Hill Island, Antarctic Peninsula . Charlene, whose 2011 encounter with the seal was filmed by a friend, had at first wondered why the seal was so friendly but later learned about the harsh weaning process. She said: 'Basically the mother fattens them up with her milk for a month or so, then abandons them on the beach. 'They have never been in the ocean to learn to fish or anything and basically lay there starving until they figure out to take the leap of faith and go into the sea. 'This is why they can be so sweet and looking for love, I guess.' However, an encounter with a full-grown elephant would have been a different prospect. Males of the species can weigh up to two tonnes and are known to have a nasty temper during mating season as the battle to control harems of females.

(CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are "conscientious objectors," and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new "no jab, no pay" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. "The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments," said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. "It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing," Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.

Many people might think that trust issues, long distances and cheating scandals are the biggest strains on a relationship. But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.

James Bond would have lasted just seven minutes into his last movie Skyfall before succumbing to fatal wounds from a uranium shot if the secret agent played by Daniel Craig was real. A group of medical experts watched the 23rd outing for Ian Fleming's hero and concluded that Bond would have been unlikely to survive to the end of the two hour film, and would have died or been critically injured several times . Within the first seven minutes, Bond is hit by a depleted uranium shell - an armour-piercing round normally used to destroy tanks that would almost certainly have killed the hero. Scroll down for video . James Bond would have died minutes into Skyfall - after being hit by a depleted uranium shell and then falling from a speeding train, where he could easily have severed his spine . As Bond fights in an icy loch he would have been likely to have died from the cold or lack of oxygen . In a feature for Total Film, the medical experts examine several different action movies to see whether the man characters would have survived their ordeal. Other movies to undergo the medical assessment were Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis. Unsurprisingly John McClane would not have survived. According to the experts, Bond's depleted uranium wound would have been fatal as it 'would have turned his lungs inside out and killed him'. In the unlikely event the massive round did not cause catastrophic injuries, the radioactive nature of the ammunition 'would greatly increase his cancer risk'. Bond cheats death throughout the two hour film, including when he is locked in a gunfight on the streets of Istanbul as he attempts to chase villain Patrice for a hard drive containing details of undercover agents . The hero effortlessly performs surgery on himself, but would have been likely to have lost too much blood . Not that growing old gracefully was ever likely for James Bond, who at one stage performs surgery on himself to remove a bullet, where he 'risks blood loss, lack of consciousness, nerve and muscle damage'. He also faces a significant risk of infection. Even jumping from the roof of a speeding train into a river presents its own risks, which probably should not be tried by ordinary members of the public as he would likely 'sever his spinal cord or break his neck'. 7 mins - Bond is shot in the chest by a depleted uranium bullet, likely to kill. If he had survived this the radioactive qualities of the ammunition would have increased his risk of cancer. 12 mins - The action hero is shot and then jumps from the roof of a speeding train into a river. The height of this fall would be likely to break his neck. 31 mins - After being shot Bond bravely removes a bullet from his shoulder. This DIY surgery would have led to significant blood loss as well as damaged his nerves and muscles. 2hrs - Bond fights in an icy loch. While the temperature alone would have presented problems, fighting underwater would have significantly depleted Bond's oxygen supply and could have caused him to drown. While James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 has survived since 1960, it is unlikely the man himself would have . However, filming the movie can prove slightly dangerous as Daniel Craig has recently required knee surgery after hurting himself while performing a stunt in his final Bond movie Spectre. Even Home Alone would have produced three fatalities. Marv and Harry would have likely died within hours of the movie's end while Kevin would have been killed within the first third of the film after falling from some shelves. However, Tom Hanks in Cast Away could have plausibly survived on a desert island for four years - as long as he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash. Although according to the experts, 76 per cent of the time he would have died in the accident. While Bruce WIllis' character in Die Hard, John McClane, pictured, would not have made it to the fourth movie . Tom Hanks in Castaway could have survived on the island - in the unlikely event he escaped the aircraft .

Need to have a difficult conversation with your other half or your boss? It might be a good idea to take them out to dinner. We get on better with each other over a meal, according to researchers who said it makes everyone from work colleagues to children seem more pleasant. Dutch and Canadian scientists asked nearly 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent at least five minutes talking to someone else. Well digested: Scientists have found people felt happier and more relaxed while eating at home or at work . About a fifth of the 1,000 meetings recorded took place over a meal, the journal Physiology and Behavior reports. On these occasions participants felt happier and more relaxed, whether at home, at work or elsewhere. They felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments and were more likely to make compromises. They also believed that the person they were with was warmer and more likeable. And hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. One possible explanation is that chewing raises levels of the ‘feel-good’ brain chemical serotonin. Food for thought: The study found that people can talk about tricky subjects far easier over a meal . It is also possible that shared meals enhance our inbuilt desire to be accepted and to please others. Marije aan het Rot, of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, said that tricky topics might be best tackled over a meal. Bosses and employees and also parents and children, might all find it easier to get on at the table while dinner may not be the best idea for a first date. Dr Rot said the people in her study knew each other and the effect of a sharing a meal might be different among strangers. Apart from anything else, meals can be lengthy and people meeting for the first time might struggle to come up with enough conversation.

Have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door, been woken by a Facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger? To deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies, one company has designed a range of prototype products. You can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product, funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Scroll down for video . Leeds-based Direct Line is running a competition called #EverydayFix. They asked groups to design products to deal with common problems. These include forgetting to lock the door, which one company hopes to solve with their Forget Me Lock prototype, shown . The products were designed as part of the Direct Line Everyday Fix design makeathon. They asked people to pick their top ten ‘everyday emergencies’ - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives. Groups from London-based design company Makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist. 1. Not being able to sleep (46 per cent*) 2. Losing your keys (37 per cent) 3. Being stuck in traffic when already late (35 per cent) 4. Losing an important paper or document (33 per cent) 5. Nowhere to park (32 per cent) 6. Printer not working when you need to print something (31 per cent) 7. Running out of battery on your phone whilst out (31 per cent) 8. Discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo (30 per cent) 9. Dealing with machine operated customer service (26 per cent) 10. Forgetting your bank card when paying for an item (25 per cent) *How many people thought this was a problem . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called ‘Snooze’, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep. To deal with not remembering if you had locked your door, ONN Studio created the Forget Me Lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door. It fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. This means that even when out or about, you can find out if your door is locked or not. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost. Direct Line is running a competition on Twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about Snooze, Forget Me Lock or Nipper. The Forget Me Lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key. When the key is turned in a lock it swivels green  to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost . The Nipper device (shown) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called Snooze, shown, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep . Whichever tweet has the most retweets, with the #EverydayFix hashtag, by 23 April will go into a Kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development. ‘We’ve seen the great British designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies,’ said Paul Smyth, co-founder of Makerversity. ‘Through the Direct Line Everyday Fix event, we’ve been able to extend our role as "fixers" and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation’s everyday emergencies,’ added John Shaw, head of R&D and Innovation at Direct Line. Of the products that didn’t make the cut, one was a helmet with ‘bone conduction headphones’ that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you. Another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space, which would then alert you when the space was free, if you couldn’t find somewhere to park. And as another solution to your phone running out of battery, one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies. Products that didn't make the final shortlist included the Parking Pin, shown. You could leave this in a parking space, and it will alert you when the space is free, so you can park your car . The Relay app, shown, would let you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies . And the 'Hat Nav' was a smart helmet that used ‘bone conduction headphones’ to give you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .

A cancer survivor who had to have part of his mouth removed after a tumour stopped him from swallowing has been given a new tongue made out of part of his arm. David Billing, 48, has told how he had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital, during which surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue. Medics then replaced the lost tissue with muscle from Mr Billing's arm. The only drawback is that it still has hairs on it, and he now has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved. David Billing, 48, had to have part of his tongue removed after being diagnosed with mouth cancer, so doctors made him a new one out of skin from his arm - which still has hairs on it . The dramatic story began after Mr Billing, a part-time welder, went to his GP in October 2013 after being unable to swallow. After a second doctor's appointment, he was referred to Royal Derby where specialists discovered an ulcer on the right-hand side of his tongue and confirmed it was cancer after a biopsy. He said: 'Being told I had cancer was mind-blowing and a real low point for me. I had no idea when they found this ulcer in my mouth that this was what it would be.' It was a double-blow for Mr Billing, as he had been made redundant just a week before from his job at digger manufacturer JCB. He said: 'It was all so overwhelming. My life and everything was ticking along nicely and the next thing I knew I'd lost my job and needed to have a major operation.' David had the procedure to remove the lump and rebuild his tongue on November 13, 2013. He said: 'I had to have a stomach tube fitted first and then go through the main procedure. Mr Billing was forced to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital (pictured), with surgeons sawing between two teeth and through his jaw to get to the tumour . 'They had to cut through the jawbone and get my face wide open to get to the ulcer then they had to remove some lymph nodes in my neck too, just to be safe in case the cancer had spread.' David spent nine days in hospital after his operation, returning now only for check-ups and once for the smaller procedure to reshape his tongue. He said: 'Usually, people have to go on chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the operation and, during this, the skin tissue used to rebuild the tongue shrinks in size. 'Because I didn't need either, it meant I later needed this smaller operation to have the bit of skin trimmed. 'My tongue's absolutely fine. I had to have speech therapy after the procedure but it's not had any long term impact on my speech or my eating or drinking.' David continued to use a feeding tube and relied on liquid foods until his first proper meal on Christmas Day 2013. And, in another fortunate turn of events, he was offered his old job a JCB back in March 2014. He added: 'JCB actually took me back having originally laid me off because of a lack of work. Mr Billing, who is now preparing to run the London Marathon to raise money for Cancer Research, says his speech is back to normal - though he does have to go to hospital to have his tongue shaved . 'It was the best feeling in the world when, two weeks after coming through the operation, the consultant told me the cancer was completely removed and I didn't even need radiotherapy or chemotherapy.' Now David is preparing to run the London Marathon and is hoping to raise more than £3,000 for cancer research. He said: 'I was not fit or well at all when I was watching the London Marathon last year but I thought how much I'd love to do it. 'I've never done anything like it before so, when I started feeling better, I decided to start training and now I'm about to take part in this experience of a lifetime. 'If I can get over the finish line, whatever time I do it in, it will be absolutely brilliant.'

The lovers who got the most complaints in New York City for loud sex are a handyman and the girlfriend he pops round for quickies with in the building where he works. The 25-year-old boytoy is the lover, of a Dominican woman in her late 30s, who invites him round for romps around her entire apartment in Brooklyn. The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex. Most complained: The building maintenance worker (left) and his girlfriend (right), who is now four months pregnant, were complained about six times for excessive noise at the Bay Ridge block, official records show . Say it loud: This is the apartment block with six calls made to 311 - New York city's non-emergency number - because of complaints of loud sex . Blue: The woman who was complained about was spoken to by police today. She later left, saying: 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone.' The woman whose moans during sex sparked the highest number of complaints in New York said today: 'I'm not hurting anyone'. The woman, who declined to give her name, walked out of the apartment block wearing striped maxi dres, a white jacket and sunglasses. She looked upset and said she was hurt by all the attention - and revealed she was pregnant. She said: 'I'm four months pregnant. 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'. On the job: The building handyman complained about over noisy sex was at work today - at the apartment block where his girlfriend lives. House of noise: The apartment building is in Bay Ridge, close to New York harbor in Brooklyn . No idea: The building's owner Madelene Behefte told Daily Mail Online she had no idea about the complaints . No respite: The front door of the apartment at the center of six complaints for noisy sex. It failed to stop neighbors from overhearing the couple's antics . DNAInfo reported that New York's 311 helpline, for non-emergency complaints to city authorities, recorded a total of 133 complaints about loud sex between January 1 2014 and February 12 2015. Brooklyn, the borough now associated with trendy hipsters and home to would-be president Hillary Clinton's campaign, had the highest number of complaints, at 42. Brooklyn is the most populous of the city's five boroughs. Queens was next with 37, the Bronx and 31 and Manhattan had 23. Staten Island recorded none. The website reported that on November 14 last year, a 311 operator logged: 'Neighbors are having very loud sex with the windows open that can be heard throughout the whole bldg.' The complainant told the website the woman was 'moaning and screaming "Oh yeah, oh, do it to me".' It was followed by another woman shouting at the couple: 'Shut your f***ing windows you wh**e.' Complaints to 311 are passed to police to investigate if they are available, but officers found no noise disturbance when they attended the Bay Ridge block.

Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless. The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, José Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than £300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for.

There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight. Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout. 'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'

Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to quit because he was becoming increasing depressed watching cable news . Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to call time on his 17 year reign because he was becoming increasing depressed by American politics and watching cable news. Speaking for the first time since making his shock decision, Stewart said he was looking forward to not having to watch the 'relentless' 24-hour news networks anymore. 'Watching these channels all day is incredibly depressing,' Stewart told The Guardian. 'I live in a constant state of depression. I think of us as turd miners. I put on my helmet, I go and mine turds, hopefully I don't get turd lung disease.' Asked if he'd ever voluntarily watch Fox News, Stewart said, 'Let's say that it's a nuclear winter, and I have been wandering, and there appears to be a flickering light through what appears to be a radioactive cloud and I think that light might be a food source that could help my family. 'I might glance at it for a moment until I realize, that's Fox News, and then I shut it off.' Stewart also confessed that his 'moments of dissatisfaction' with the show had started to become more frequent. 'It's not like I thought [The Daily Show] wasn't working any more, or that I didn't know how to do it. It was more, "Yup, it's working. But I'm not getting the same satisfaction,'" he said. 'These things are cyclical. You have moments of dissatisfaction, and then you come out of it and it's OK. But the cycles become longer and maybe more entrenched, and that's when you realize, "OK, I'm on the back side of it now.'" Scroll down for video . Stewart said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance in 2011 . Even the upcoming 2016 Presidential election campaign couldn't reignite Stewart's passion the way it once did. 'I'd covered an election four times, and it didn't appear that there was going to be anything wildly different about this one,' said Stewart. 'Honestly, it was a combination of the limitations of my brain and a format that is geared towards following an increasingly redundant process, which is our political process. 'I was just thinking, "Are there other ways to skin this cat?' And, beyond that, it would be nice to be home when my little elves get home from school, occasionally." Stewart also said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance. The former secretary of defense appeared on The Daily Show in 2011 for an interview, which the comedian says he messed up. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, left, would be taking over . 'He just went into the general gobbledegook,' said Stewart. "Mnah mnah mnah, well, you have to remember, it was 9/11 mnah mnah." I should have pushed, but he's very adept at deflecting.' Rumsfeld, who was on the show to promote his memoir, Known And Unknown, dodged Stewart's questions about faulty U.S. intelligence leading up to the Iraq War. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, 31, would be taking over. Noah has already had to combat  accusations of anti-Semitism over a series of old tweets. Stewart has voiced his full support for his successor, recently calling the incoming host 'incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart.' The exiting host told The Guardian that one reason for  stepping down early in the presidential election cycle was to give Noah a big story to tackle. Stewart said he felt 'that, for the show, you don't want to leave when the cupboard's bare. So I think it's a better introduction when you have something providing you with assisted fuel, like a presidential campaign.'

An eight-grade girl accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in adult jail while awaiting trial, a judge. A defense petition to return 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek to the juvenile facility where she was initially sent after the body of 54-year-old Cheryl Silvonek was discovered last month was denied by Lehigh County Judge Maria Dantos on Friday. District Attorney Jim Martin had opposed the petition on behalf of the teenager, who is charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy. Her boyfriend, Caleb Barnes, 20, who is from El Paso, Texas, but was stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, is charged with homicide. JamieSilvonek, the eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, it was ruled on Friday . Cheryl Silvonek's body was found with stab wounds in a shallow grave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and her vehicle partially submerged in a pond a few miles from the family home. Jamie Silvonek was sent to the county jail this month after she was charged as an adult and is in the women's housing unit, away from older inmates, county officials said. Authorities said Barnes and the teenager met in October, when she was 13, but she told him she was 17. Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. The teen's mother found out about their relationship in early March and ordered them to end it. A day later, the teen told Barnes in a text message, 'I want her gone,' police said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. The 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. 14-year-old JamieSilvonek allegedly conspired to kill her mother Cheryl Silvonek with her 20-year-old boyfriend 'because she disapproved of their relationship' Barnes confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, and that given the age disparity 'there has to be some type of duress or coercion'. He said his client 'cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom' and she feared for her life and that of her father. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life . Police found the body of Cheryl Silvonek in a shallow grave a few miles from her home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby .

Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed for a year after orchestrating a scam to steal £15,000 of goods from the Asda in Basildon, Essex, where he worked . An Asda manager orchestrated a scam that used the supermarket's own delivery service to steal goods worth more than £15,000 - then managed to land a job at Lidl after he was sacked. Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed after running the scam where stock including alcohol, cigarettes, DVDs, computer games and consoles were taken from the store in Basildon, Essex, where he worked. Southend Crown Court heard how the conspiracy was uncovered, following a period during which Gridley and colleague Jay Reed were under suspicion. Thomas Daniel, prosecuting, told the court that goods, ranging from televisions to baby formula, were delivered to Reed's address and presumably sold on. He said: 'Two anonymous reports were received by Asda, one of which suggested Mr Gridley was involved in selling items believed to have been stolen, such as TVs and baby formula. 'When Mr Gridley was ill for a certain period of time, those deliveries stopped, and when he recovered they started again. 'Another email suggested stolen goods being delivered to the address of Mr Gridley's cousin.' But shockingly, after being sacked from the store, Gridley managed to land a managerial role at Lidl in Romford, Essex. Gridley, who was former home shopping manager of the store, was sentenced to 12 months for his leading role in a conspiracy to steal £15,852.46 worth of goods between November 2013 and April last year. The court heard that Reed and another defendant James Munyard had been pressured into taking part in the scam by Gridley, who was their superior. Stock including alcohol, cigarettes were taken from shelves and delivered to addresses using the supermarket's own home delivery service. File photo . Section leader Reed, 23, and Munyard, 21, both avoided prison, but were given suspended sentences of eight and four months, respectively. Mitchell Cohen, representing Munyard, told the court that his client, whose role was confined to taking items off shelves and putting them in a crate, had attempted to be transferred from the store in order to escape Gridley's control. James Munyard (pictured) avoided jail for his part in the scam . Reed was deemed to have been in a position of trust and responsibility in the criminal enterprise, but Recorder Gerard Pounder said he had a lesser role than Gridley, 26, and Munyard even less so. Despite hearing Gridley, of Tilbury,  financially supported his former partner and their two-year-old child but also his own father and grandparents, Recorder Pounder said he had no choice but to send him to prison. He said: 'You were in a position of supreme trust and you say you started this because of threats made regarding a drug debt of your cousin's, you continued even as those threats faded, and brought other people in, too.' Sentencing Reed to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 200 hours' unpaid work, he said: 'You were in a lesser role than Mr Gridley but you were a section leader and had responsibilities. 'In that respect you were somebody who knew the system and it was to your premises these items were taken - without that and your part in the enterprise, it would not have worked.' Munyard, who Mr Cohen said 'didn't have the spine to stand up to what he was being asked to do,' was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, and 100 hours' unpaid work. A spokesperson for Lidl told MailOnline they are unable to comment until an internal investigation has been conducted.

The 14-time major champion is bidding to win his fifth green jacket, but has been plagued by a succession of injuries and even the chipping yips in recent times. The world will find out which version of Woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48pm. Defending champion Bubba Watson, hoping to win his third Masters title in four years, will tee off at 2.24pm alongside England's former US Open champion Justin Rose and 21-year-old South Korean amateur Gunn Yang, who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the US Amateur last year. Those watching the 2.02pm group on Thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game's most colourful characters go head-to-head. Ian Poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet, but even he might meet his match in American young gun Patrick Reed, who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at Doral last year. He followed that up by shushing the home crowd during a cocksure display at Gleneagles. Three-time Masters champion Phil MIckelson, hitting from behind trees during practice, will play alongside McIlroy in the first two rounds . Ryan Moore, pictured during a practice round at Augusta, will join McIlroy and Mickelson on the course for round one and two .

US Open champion Martin Kaymer is in the group behind world No 1 McIlroy, with Brandt Snedeker and Houston Open winner JB Holmes. McIlroy and Mickelson were among the players battling for the US PGA title in near-darkness at Valhalla last year, with Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light. With 98 players in the field, Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45pm (7:45am local time), with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier, the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while Arnold Palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder. England's Danny Willett will begin his Masters debut in the second group at 12:56pm alongside 1987 winner Larry Mize and US amateur public links champion Byron Meth. Woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth Masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round. The American superstar has started just two events in 2015, carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second, but said he was ready to 'compete to win a golf tournament' after 11 holes of practice on Monday. The final group tees off at 1:59pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world, Australia's Jason Day, Spain's Sergio Garcia and Fowler. Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors last year.

A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by £345 to £975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from £870 to £1,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices . The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from £870 to £1,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game . Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay £345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost £975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season . Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.

A pregnant mother with a rare form of dwarfism has revealed the physical challenges of raising her three-year-old son - who is more than half her size - while preparing for the arrival of her second child. Tiffanie DiDonato, from Swansboro, North Carolina, was born with diastrophic dysplasia and underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries as a child so she would grow to be 4'10 tall, instead of her previous height of 3'8, which is how tall her son Titan currently is. But even with the additional inches, parenting a rambunctious toddler can be difficult for the 34-year-old mom who has certain physical limitations, and often has to use crutches, or sometimes a wheelchair, in addition to being three months pregnant. 'Titan is a typical kid – he wants to do what he wants to do,' she told People of her son. 'And chasing him outside or across the street is not an option for me.' Helping hand: Tiffanie DiDonato, who has diastrophic dysplasia, a rare form of dwarfism, can be seen grocery shopping with her three-year-old son Titan, who is more than half her size, but always willing to assist her . Making it work: The 34-year-old mom from Swansboro, North Carolina, is 4'10 tall and is constantly re-teaching herself to walk because of the stiff muscles and arthritis, which are side effects of her dwarfism . Tiffanie, who married to Eric Gabrielse, a 6’1, 29-year-old Marine who is 6'0, explained that she has to get creative when it comes to dealing with her son - especially when he throws himself on the floor and cries. When tantrums occurs she will walk way and say: 'Mommy can't help when you're yelling at me... No crying and Mommy can help.' Tiffanie noted that this trick, which she has developed over time, usually prompts her son to get up and give her a hug. 'I try my best to let him know throwing tantrums doesn't get you very far - a great lesson to learn, don't you think?' she said. Great news: Tiffanie and her husband Eric Gabrielse, a 29-year-old Marine, are expecting their second child in September . All smiles: Titan happily cuddled up to his dad for this snapshot . Full of life: The three-year-old had a laugh while his dad Eric enjoyed his breakfast . Tiffanie, who co-wrote the memoir Dwarf with Rennie Dyball, has difficulty lifting Titan now that is getting taller because her arms are significantly shorter than most moms. The stiff muscles and arthritis that are side effects of her condition mean that she has to constantly re-teach herself how to walk - which makes chasing after Titan impossible. Losing control of her son is one of her greatest fears, which is why she avoids leaving the house with Titan when she doesn’t her husband Eric or another family member by her side. 'I have even watched Eric struggle to catch him outside and he's a Marine!' she explained. ‘We named Titan correctly, because he's almost too speedy and too athletic.' Because she 'wouldn't stand a chance' against outracing her son, she makes sure she stays '10 steps ahead of the game' at all times. Overcoming obstacles: Tiffanie can be seen as a child wearing braces on her legs. She underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries when she was younger .

Tiffanie recalled times in which Titan has climbed into the dryer or wedged himself behind the couch or plopped himself inside the sink.

An Old Bailey judge has blasted his junior colleague for ‘taking his eye off the ball’ and passing an 'unlawful' sentence when letting a BT manager dodge jail for a £28,000 expenses scam. Wheelchair-bound  Christopher Starrs, 50, was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in January after admitting his part in a two-and-a-half year con against his employer BT. Starrs, along with fellow BT Openreach manager Phillip Tamplin, invented clamped cars, overtime hours and damage to home owners’ property during broadband installation, and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims. Blasted: Judge Nicholas Cooke QC (left) blasted his junior colleague Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC (right) for 'taking his eye off the ball' when he sentenced Christopher Starrs in January this year . Both Starrs and Tamplin, 53, who made £124,000 from the con, admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses. Tamplin was jailed for two years at January's sentencing hearing, but Mr Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC spared Starrs jail as an ‘act of mercy’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £1,500 fine. However, senior Judge Nicholas Cooke QC has now said the sentence was ‘unlawful’ - and added Starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes. ‘It was an unlawful sentence passed and now I need to do something to put it right, because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter,’ he said. ‘He was mercifully dealt with, sadly by a judge who didn’t have his eye on the ball.’ The judge told Mark Haslam, defending: ‘The sentence was wrong but that’s a matter of personal opinion. ‘Your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison. ‘What the Recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn’t available to him. ‘No one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on Mr Starrs was unlawful. ‘I am sorry to be the headmaster but we really don’t want this sort of thing.’ Fraud: Wheelchair-bound Starrs, 50, was a manager with BT who admitted defrauding the company of £28,000 over two years . The Recorder, who is the head of 4 Bream Buildings chambers and took the Silk in 2006, gave Starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine, and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue. But Judge Cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order. Turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing, he added: ‘This is supposed to be a centre of excellence, when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and can’t do. ‘The judge should have been told what his powers were.’ Prosecutor John Ojakovoh said Starrs offered a ‘blank cheque’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £28,000 he stole. After the judge heard the CPS will now drop the confiscation proceedings, he said the original sentence will stand, quipping: ‘He no doubt thanks his lucky stars.’ Both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time. The main fraudulent claim was for BT vehicles which had been ‘clamped’ by parking authorities. BT Openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work. The company pays out around £1million in fines in London alone every year. Starrs and Tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates. Sentencing Recorder Trimmer, who has led a string of high-profile Serious Fraud Office prosecutions in the last two years, said: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time. ‘It involved over 100 or so false claims, made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity. ‘Both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity. ‘You both knew how it could be conducted, concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally.’ Starrs, of Northolt, Middlesex, who had worked at BT since 1988, was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair. He was not at court today due to a mix-up over whether he was required to attend.

A forensic psychiatrist has testified that Lou Gehrig's disease is the reason a former sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his wife and sister-in-law, whom the defendant described in a suicide note as his threesome partners. Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.

The US body that regulates Internet addresses is looking to crack down on a Canadian company using the new '.sucks' domain name to extract exorbitant sums from celebrities such as Kevin Spacey and companies looking to protect their reputations. So far, purchased names include Youtube.sucks, Bing.sucks, Visa.sucks, Bankofamerica.sucks, Yahoo.sucks, Telusmobility.sucks and other major brand names. Kevin Spacey has reportedly paid have his his '.sucks' domain taken down. Kevin Spacey is reportedly among celebrities paying out to have their name removed from one of the  '.sucks' domains which opened on 30 March . Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains attacking her, CNBC reported. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or 'ICANN,'  sent a letter on Thursday to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Office of Consumer Affairs to see if the actions of company Vox Populi Registry Ltd. were illegal. ICANN initially approved of the so-called top-level domain name, among nearly 600 it has added recently to expand beyond common names such as '.com,' '.org' and '.us.' But it is backtracking after an advisory panel made up of industry groups and companies like Microsoft, Verizon and eBay complained last month. Vox Populi began accepting registrations using '.sucks' on March 30 from trademark holders and celebrities before it is released to public applicants. Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains . It has recommended charging $2,499 a year for the privilege, and according to Vox Populi CEO John Berard, most of the names have been sold by resellers for around $2,000 a year. Berard has said the domain name is meant to create destinations for companies to interact with their critics and called his company's business 'well within the lines of ICANN rules and the law.' Two weeks ago, the advisory body called the Intellectual Property Constituency representing major companies and industry groups asked ICANN in a letter to halt the rollout of '.sucks,' calling it a 'shakedown scheme' and 'predatory.' Companies like GoDaddy.com register some domain names for just $1 a year, and Vox Populi will offer consumers the right to secure a '.sucks' address for just $10 a year starting in September. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme.' ICANN said in its letter that if Canadian or U.S. regulators find Vox Populi's actions are illegal, it could declare the company in breach of its contract and seek to change the registry's behavior. It said it is also seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme .

The semi-final line-up for the Champions League has been confirmed and, although there may be no English involvement, four European giants are just three games from being crowned champions of the continent in Berlin on June 6. With Real Madrid and Juventus winning on Wednesday to join Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the last four, this season's competition is one of the toughest to call in recent memory. We asked our team of reporters who they think will win this season's Champions League. SAMI MOKBEL - Barcelona . Momentum is key at this point in the season and Barcelona are in overdrive. Their early-season woes are a distant memory and Luis Enrique is finally getting his point across. Lionel Messi remains phenomenal and a certain Luis Suarez is hitting top gear just at the right time. Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left) , Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) NEIL ASHTON - Bayern Munich . They overcame their blip (the rip in the seam of Pep's trousers) to power their way beyond Porto in the second leg of the quarter-final and remind everyone just how good they are. They have much to prove after last season's disappointment but they are a phenomenal team. I expect them to draw Barcelona in the semi-final. Bayern Munich produced a stunning display in the second leg to beat Porto in the quarter-finals . JOE BERNSTEIN - Barcelona . Bayern and Barcelona are both better teams than Juventus or Real Madrid and to separate them is nigh on impossible. But given the backroom strife at Bayern, particularly over Arjen Robben's injury, I'd narrowly go for Messi and Barcelona ending their four-year Champions League 'drought'. DOMINIC KING - Barcelona . To think at the start of the season, after Real Madrid pummelled them in the first Clasico, that we thought the beginning of the end had started. Now they look majestic once more and the front three of Messi, Neymar and Suarez gives them an edge over all their rivals. Hopefully it will be a straight shootout between them and Bayern Munich in Berlin. This is the best Champions League semi-final line-up ever and we might get the spectacular final to go with it. LEE CLAYTON - Juventus . Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba and Gianluigi Buffon -  experience, goals and know-how. Tevez isn't Messi (or Cristiano Ronaldo), Pogba isn't Thomas Muller and Buffon isn't Manuel Neuer: Yes, they are ugly bugs on a catwalk of super powers, but they CAN win this. After all, Denmark and Greece both won the Euros. Juventus celebrate their 1-0 aggregate victory over Monaco in the last eight of the Champions League . Juventus striker Carlos Tevez leads the scoring in Serie A this season with 18 goals . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI - Barcelona . Since it's been established that we don't live in a post-Messi (48 goals in 49 starts) world I can't bring myself to bet against him. Would love to see them in a final against Bayern Munich. CHRIS WHEELER - Bayern Munich . After that crushing 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the semi-finals a year ago, and the shock of suffering a 3-1 first-leg loss to Porto in this season’s quarters, expect the real Bayern to stand up and deliver another Champions League triumph for Guardiola. Is it written in the stars that Barcelona will be standing in his way? LAURIE WHITWELL - Barcelona . The front three of Messi, Suarez, and Neymar are beginning to click to devastating effect and the magical allure of Barcelona is returning. It would be some turnaround from the disputes and disappointments of early season, but this is a team full of players who know how to win the trophy. Neymar scored both goals in Barcelona's 2-0 second-leg victory over Paris Saint-Germain at the Nou Camp . LAURA WILLIAMSON - Real Madrid . They might be depleted by injuries but experience and pedigree count in this competition and, as we saw against Atletico Madrid, you can never count against the 10-time winners. Or, indeed, a certain Ronaldo. Javier Hernandez's 88th-minute winner saw Real Madrid edge past their local rivals Atletico Madrid . Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League title and a second in a row with Real Madrid . ROB DRAPER - Bayern Munich . Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben are on the way back, Pep  has a point to prove and the team have the memory of that awful semi-final against Real Madrid last year to drive them on. As long as they don't take their foot off the gas having already won the Bundesliga, they'll make good the disappointment of last year. Robert Lewandowski celebrates one of five first-half goals Bayern Munich scored against Porto on Tuesday . JACK GAUGHAN - Barcelona . I'm tempted to say Bayern Munich but they've got similar buckling deficiencies to the Barcelona we've seen recently. By contrast, the Catalans have found their misplaced defensive steel, have a coach whose win percentage eclipses all to precede him and - well - possess Messi. And Neymar. And Suarez. SAM CUNNINGHAM - Bayern Munich . I would back Guardiola to outwit any of the remaining managers in the tournament with the players at his disposal. Some were writing Bayern Munich off after their 3-1 first-leg defeat by Porto and look how that went. Everyone talks about Messi and Ronaldo, but the collective force of Bayern players is frightening. OLIVER TODD - Barcelona . After a difficult start to the season they've hit form at the right time. Enrique has found a way to get the front three of Messi,  Suarez and Neymar to fire and even if you can keep two of them quiet - as Paris Saint-Germain did on Tuesday - the other will make you pay.

Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.

Steve Davis would love to see Jimmy White and Reanne Evans light up the Crucible stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn. The king of the baize in the 1980s believes the Whirlwind and the doyenne of the women's tour face tall orders to get through qualifying for the Betfred World Championship. Evans saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion Ken Doherty on Thursday, in the first of three preliminary rounds, while White will tackle fellow veteran James Wattana in his opener on Saturday. Steve Davis will attempt to qualify for this year's Betfred World Championship at the Crucible . But Davis, who will also attempt to qualify, expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in Sheffield. He calls 29-year-old Dudley potter Evans 'a great player', and said of the 10-time ladies' world champion: 'It's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods. It's a bun fight, but she's perhaps the best woman player I've ever seen. 'In the 1980s I saw Allison Fisher who was the best around, and she was an excellent, excellent player but more methodical. 'Reanne is more like the Jimmy White or the Ronnie O'Sullivan of the women's game. She has the feel for the game, she's at one with the table. 'She could cause a surprise, but to win three matches is the tough bit. It's hard enough for me and Jimmy. 'If me or Jimmy qualify for the Crucible, it's arguably as big a win as we've ever had. 'I've got a little bit of a desire to do it, but Jimmy would certainly love to get back to the Crucible.' Reanne Evans takes on Ken Docherty for a place at the World Championships in Sheffield . Reanne Evans is a 10-time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010-11 season. She suffered 18 consecutive defeats however and failed to qualify the following year. White, who lost six World Championship finals, last appeared at the tournament in 2006, and has fallen short in qualifying every year since. While 52-year-old White is in the autumn of his career, for Davis these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down. He turns 58 in August and fell off the main tour 12 months ago. A memoir, Interesting, hits the bookshelves on Thursday. A tricky qualifying opener against Jamie Cope could end in disappointment, but it would be short-lived. 'I can't build up the intensity that I used to have, but I must admit I'm getting excited about pitting my wits against another generation of players,' Davis said. 'Of course, it'll all end in tears. 'I'm not totally committed but I still have the juices running through me a little bit. I've been practising but it's not a pretty sight. They're wobbling more in the pockets before saying 'nope'. 'Whether I get to the TV stages, that's a long shot. That's tough. Jimmy White will take on fellow veteran James Wattana in qualifying on Thursday . 'I was still practising hard even when I wasn't getting to the latter stages of the Crucible, and in the end you have to say, 'Yeah, I've tried, but the price is too much investment of time'. 'Now if I've lost a match, by the time I've got in the car I've thought about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day, rather than beating up the person who's come up with me. 'I think it's been a bit like Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I'm sure in the night that someone swapped me for a more mellow version.' Davis won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament, but the 1985 'black-ball final' defeat to Dennis Taylor stands over and above all memories. Dennis Taylor in action during the memorable 1985 World Championship final against Davis . The second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant Davis having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again. 'I don't remember anything as much as I remember the '85 final,' Davis said. 'I do remember the last frame, more so because I've watched it through on video a few times. 'My career was a blur and all games and matches blur into one in the end, it's only the strange moments that do stick in your brain.'

(CNN)Is America a nation divided?  And has Ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions? It's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation: immigration, community and police relations, poverty, education and dozens of other crucial matters facing America. Adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite, and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country. In Ohio, we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services, criminal justice, economic competiveness, infrastructure -- and I've enjoyed sharing our state's winning formula with others in my travels. In 2011, I returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in Congress in the 1980s and '90s.  Over the intervening years, Ohio had lost its way and was hurting. I felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 Ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet. Ohio is much stronger today. And that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing. For example, we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation's strongest state budgets and a nearly $2 billion surplus. We've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones. We've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in America, including tax cuts for the working poor. We're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and Ohio's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade. Getting Ohio back on track wasn't easy. It required big ideas, going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests. Yes, we have a great success story to tell about our state. And we need to make Ohio's success contagious. The leadership style that helped us turn around Ohio is needed in Washington, where America's $18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting Mother's Day if it required their action. Great leaders are not primarily guided by polls, political parties, focus groups, re-election, special interests or protecting the status quo. Instead they bring teams of people together, challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee in Congress in the 1990s, I helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. We worked in a bipartisan effort that doesn't happen enough. There were, of course, disagreements along the way, but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means. Given the polarizing issues facing our country, America needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego, selfishness and power produce. Leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets, tax cuts, welfare reform, border security, immigration and health care. We see it every day. There are certain values that guide great countries: . • Personal responsibility: It obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities. • Empathy: It allows us to walk in someone else's shoes, so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another, better way that makes all of us stronger. • Teamwork: It sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win. • Faith: It tells us we are made special in the image of God with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth. These values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all Americans instead of producing rhetoric, sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform. In Ohio we've implemented this winning strategy. It's worked there, and it will work for the nation as well.

A tortoise has been reunited with his owner after spending nearly a year on the run and even finding a new home - at the age of 109. Owner Wendy Stokes, 74, had given up hope of ever seeing Toby again after he escaped from her garden 11 months ago. But he has now returned home and after piecing together his escapades over the last year, it's become apparent he's had quite an adventure. Reunited: Wendy Stokes, 74, is delighted to have 109-year-old Toby back after his escape 11 months ago . He wandered through a gate in her garden and headed for the open road where he was picked up by a passing driver concerned for his safety and taken to a nearby animal rescue centre. Six months ago, he was re-homed with a couple living in Margate, Kent, 22 miles away from Wendy's farm in West Hougham. But the couple, who could just about make out the word 'Stokes' written in white paint on his shell, felt they needed to find out who Tony belonged to. With nothing else to go on, they decided to call every Stokes in Kent listed in the phonebook. Eventually came across a delighted Wendy, who immediately arranged to collect him. She's had Toby since the 1980s when he was given to her by her late great aunt. He was returned home last Sunday, a full 11 months after his amazing, if a little slow, adventure. Wendy has had Toby since the 1980s and wrote her surname, Stokes, on his back in white paint . Retired farm worker Wendy said: 'I had painted my name and number on the side of his shell but it had faded when he went missing so they couldn't read it. 'The people who found him could read Stokes but they couldn't make out the number. 'He had got out because I had left my gate open. It is normally closed because we have sheep in the paddock but they were in a different field. 'Toby just walked out and trotted towards the road where somebody picked him up and took him to a rescue centre. 'Everyone knows I have a tortoise and we always take him to the village fete so he is a bit of a local celebrity. 'I was devastated when he went missing and spent weeks looking for him in all the fields around the farm.' She added: 'I went all goosey when they told me they had Toby because I had really given up on him. 'It is brilliant having him back and I think everybody was keeping their eye out for him all this time.'

A vicious swan known for terrorising punters and kayakers on the River Cam is now believed to have a grandson following in his footsteps. The savage swan nicknamed Asbaby, which still has many brown baby feathers, has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the Cambridge river. Mr Asbo, the swan believed to be his grandfather, was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 by river authorities after repeatedly attacking rowers. Scroll down for video . Watch out: Savage swan Asbaby has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the river in Cambridge over the Easter weekend . Up close: One resident who lives near the river said Asbaby 'sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers' Theft: Asbaby was seen attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag (above) Capturing the moment: Asbaby (pictured) is believed to be the grandson of Mr Asbo, who was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 . Pecking at the punters: The swan on the River Cam is said to be even more vicious than his father, Asboy, and grandfather, Asbo . Asbaby was seen at the weekend attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag. He is said to have inherited his bad temper from his grandfather, and his father Asboy, who conducted a reign of terror on the river last summer. Harry Crossell, 65, who lives near the river, said: ‘He is even more vicious than his father and grandfather. '(He) sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers. I’ve seen him chasing after punts and taking their picnics. 'Once I even saw him put his beak around a bottle of champagne. ‘It’s terrifying for river users and it’s making people think twice about going out on the water.’ Another resident, Simon Patterson, 52, said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour would get worse as he gets older. ‘The swan is only young at the moment, we’re concerned he will get stronger and more vicious as he grows bigger,’ he said. Shock: The swan got up close with this woman, whose surprise at what was unfolding in front of her could clearly be seen (right) Making an appearance: The juvenile swan nicknamed Asbaby got far too close for comfort to tourists on the Cam over the Easter weekend . Naughty swan: One resident said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour on the River Cam would get worse as he gets older . ‘He swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way. We thought Mr Asbo and Asboy were bad, but this swan is even worse. ‘It’s very worrying as the river is starting to get busier now, if he continues someone could get really hurt.’ But Colin Sparkes, navigation officer for Conservators of the River Cam, told MailOnline today: ‘Most swans get a bit aggressive this time of year. ‘It's mating season - they protect their territory. As far as I’m aware, it's not causing great problems on the river. ‘Swans this time of year start to look out for their nest, and indeed when the young and born. ‘It’s a very tricky one because the more people feed the swans, the more aggressive they tend to become. Close to the camera: Asbaby 'swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way', according to one local resident . Worrying: Asbaby's actions are said to be 'terrifying for river users' and are 'making people think twice about going out on the water' Threatening: The behaviour of Mr Asbo (above) before he was moved 60 miles three years ago left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises . No longer there: The Cam Conservators moved Mr Asbo about 60 miles away in 2012. His son Asboy is seen above in this file photograph . 'They get used to swimming up to people expecting to be fed.’ He confirmed that there are no plans to remove Asbaby from the river, adding that the case of Mr Asbo was completely different. Mr Sparkes said: ‘That swan (Mr Asbo) was extremely aggressive - it's the most aggressive swan I've ever come across. ‘I believe that was probably down to the way he'd been brought up looking for food from various people.’ The Conservators moved Mr Asbo away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself. His behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises - and a marshal was employed during a university rowing race to stop him injuring students. It has previously been reported how Asboy was seen attacking punters, birds and even a cow. He also injured a canoeist and a swimmer.

The Conservative know that they need to turn large parts of the country blue on May 7. And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate Alec Shelbrooke in Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.

After months of speculation - and years of her friends' doubts - Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has admitted she never had cancer. With her business empire destroyed and her online community in tatters, Gibson today admitted her fatal cancer 'diagnoses' were lies. 'No. None of it is true,' she said, during a series of interviews published in the latest edition of the Australian Women's Weekly. In the interviews - which questioned her relationship with the truth and her understanding of cancer - Gibson said she was not seeking forgiveness. 'I don't want forgiveness. I just think (it) was the responsible thing to do. Above anything, I would like people to say, 'Okay, she's human'. Gibson's confession was the first time she has spoken publicly since - under fire from furious former fans - she told Daily Mail Australia she feared for her family's safety. Scroll down for video . Ms Gibson revealed the truth of her cancer diagnosis in an interview . Ms Gibson, pictured kissing her son Olivier, 4, on the head, said: 'None of it was true' Her business empire in tatters and her relationship with her fans broken, Ms Gibson is thought to be struggling financially. The Women's Weekly said she was not paid for her interview . Ms Gibson's interview will be published in this month's edition of the Australian Women's Weekly . The wellness blogger was a prominent Australian social media personality. Her Instagram fan base ballooned after she 'revealed' she had prolonger her life by embracing an alternative lifestyle. Her 'whole foods' business became famously successful. Penguin published her recipe book and her app was to be offered on the Apple Watch. But it all fell apart last month after revelations emerged Ms Gibson had failed to fulfil promised donations to various charities. Friends then began to cast doubts about her cancer diagnoses. She then tearfully 'admitted' she may have been 'misdiagnosed' by a 'Dr Phil'. The  Weekly insists it did not pay for the story and that it was approached by Ms Gibson's 'people', the Melbourne 'corporate advisory' firm Bespoke Approach. Ms Gibson said her partner, Clive Rothwell, was sticking by her in spite of the controversy. But she said he had taken a 'stern' line with her and insisted she play a straight bat. 'He’s been very stern, along the lines of, ‘I just want you to acknowledge where you’ve f***ed up and try not to smooth over that,' she was quoted saying. In the article, titled 'My Lifelong Struggle With The Truth', Ms Gibson also said she had been forced to raise herself from the day she started school. She said she took upon common household responsibilities, such as bringing her brother to school and making lunches. But she would not provide her mother's name or contact details to the magazine. In her previous interview, Ms Gibson said she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion'. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) was also a popular app. It will not appear on the Apple Watch any longer . But she took aim at many of her former fans who she believed had responded 'maliciously' - claiming that her son's childcare details, home address and floor plan were published online. Former friends had called upon Ms Gibson to 'come clean' with the truth about her situation and had long privately questioned the veracity of her story. Authorities told Daily Mail Australia  at the beginning of April that Ms Gibson is still facing an official investigation. A former friend of Ms Gibson directly called on her to 'come clean' in an interview with Daily Mail Australia in March. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want'

A ‘unique and beautiful’ teenage girl was killed by a driver who crashed a stolen car while drunk and high on cocaine and cannabis. Xana Doyle, 19, was a passenger in the Toyota Avensis, which flipped and landed on its roof in an accident in the early hours of the morning. Driver Sakhawat Ali, 23, was more than twice the drink-drive limit and had been taking class A and B drugs before getting behind the wheel. Xana Doyle (pictured) was killed after driver Sakhawat Ali crashed a stolen car while high on drugs . The Toyota Avensis flipped and landed on its roof after the crash in the early hours of the morning in January . A court heard he was driving at ‘excessive speed’ in the moments before the crash, which did not involve any other vehicle. Miss Doyle, who suffered a ‘blunt head injury’, was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales. Ali admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday. Judge Neil Bidder QC told the court: ‘The driver was well over twice the drink-drive limit and it is accepted there was excessive speed.’ The judge said he wanted more information on how much cocaine and cannabis the driver had taken on the night of the smash before sentencing. Ali, of Newport, was remanded in custody ahead of a hearing in July. Sakhawat Ali (pictured right) admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking . The driver’s cousin, Shabaz Ali, 21, admitted allowing himself to be carried in a stolen car following the smash in January this year. The July hearing will decide whether he ‘contributed’ to the accident by pulling the handbrake from the back seat. Floral tributes were left at the scene of the accident and hundreds of people attended the funeral of Miss Doyle, a former Duffryn High School student, in January. In a tribute, her mother Emma O’Donoghue wrote that Xana was an ‘unusual name for a unique and beautiful girl’. Before the crash, Miss Doyle, from Newport, had recently begun working at Wetherspoons as a cook and was also a trained beautician after completing an apprenticeship. Ms O’Donoghue said yesterday: ‘No sentence will ever give me back my daughter or my children their sister. She is dearly missed and this terribly traumatic experience will remain with us for ever. ‘I am pleased that Sakhawat Ali has pleaded guilty, not that he could dispute any of the evidence presented. Miss Doyle suffered a 'blunt head injury' and was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales . Ali was remanded in custody and a hearing in July will determine if his cousin also contributed to the crash . ‘Xana was a beautiful, funny and loving girl and every day is a struggle to live on without her in our lives, we can only hope that justice is served and those responsible are held accountable.’ Paying tribute to Miss Doyle at her funeral, her mother said: ‘You had a smile that would stop this world spinning around. ‘I always knew that you were kind and loving and even through your difficult teenage years you never forgot to tell me how much you loved me and appreciated my support. ‘In the last two years you blossomed into a beautiful young woman, independent and hard-working, making us all so proud of you.’ She added that she had fond memories of her daughter playing and fooling around with her sisters, Lauren and Eve, and her brother Zane. Miss Doyle, whose white coffin was adorned with red roses, gave ‘unquivering friendship and support’ to her friends and family throughout her life, her mother added.

A young woman has managed to find her doppelgänger after launching a campaign on Facebook as a social experiment - and their likeness is mind-blowing. Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old  TV presenter from Dublin, teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed Twin Strangers to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days, and were soon inundated with submissions from all over the world. Incredibly, Niamh found her match in Karen Branigan, 29, a fellow Ireland native who lives just an hour down the road, making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together. Scroll down for video . Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Speaking to MailOnline about her first meeting with Karen, Niamh said: I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the entire duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face, and some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, "Oh my God that’s my face." 'I can’t remember the number of times I said "this is so freaky". It was truly amazing.' Karen, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Niamh has a brother and two sisters, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Niamh said the pair got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities.

'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry says. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence.

It may have been invented for students to use. But youngsters appear to be deserting Facebook in droves because it is now so popular with their parents – and grandparents. Almost a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’. The trend comes as increasing numbers of older users turn to the social network to stay in touch and share family pictures. Nearly 60 per cent of Britons aged over 55 now have a Facebook account, according to research. Facebook has even started running television adverts to entice the so-called ‘silver surfers’ to join. Now a survey of around 2,000 Britons has revealed that it is having the opposite effect on youngsters. ‘As parents are signing up, their children are logging off to maintain privacy,’ said Lord Jim Knight, chairman of online lobby group the Tinder Foundation. In the poll, a third of Facebook users are said to have blocked a family member so they can no longer see their account or do not receive automatic updates. The survey did not take account of the number of youngsters who have effectively blocked their family members by refusing to add them as a ‘Facebook friend’ in the first place. One in ten people aged 16 to 34 signed up to other platforms so they could remain ‘under the radar of their parents’. But whilst youngsters may be leaving Facebook, they are not giving up on social media altogether. More than half said they had joined Twitter, where only 13 per cent of ‘silver surfers’ said they have accounts. Meanwhile, about 40 per cent of youngsters use the picture-sharing website Instagram, according to the study commissioned by Halifax and carried out by Opinium Research. Logging off: Nearly a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their facebook accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’ Around the same proportion use Snapchat, a social media platform which automatically deletes messages shortly after they are sent. The picture was very different among the over-55s. Just three percent have an Instagram account and even fewer – around one percent – use Snapchat. The way people use these different social platforms is also changing. Around a fifth of those aged 16 to 34 use their smartphones at family dinners, posing a threat to the precious mealtimes that used to be the cornerstone on family life. By comparison, just one percent of silver surfers use their smartphones during a meal with their offspring.

Alan Pardew has warned Crystal Palace's Barclays Premier League admirers that if they want to sign Yannick Bolasie this summer then the bidding will have to start at £20million. It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.' Bolasie scores against Sunderland as he helped Crystal Palace beat the struggling Premier League side .

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini accepts his side are now facing a fight to stay in the Champions League places. City appear to have lost too much ground to Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race and their recent form has led to a further worry, with the sides behind them catching fast.

You have six or seven teams that, from the beginning, all of them play for that position. 'At the moment, for the whole year, we have been in a position of the Champions League. I hope that we will continue.' Pellegrini believes his side are now in a battle for the Champions League places and not the title . Manchester City have struggled to keep up with Chelsea, who are closing in on the Premier League trophy . The ramifications of dropping out of the top four, however, are not really something Pellegrini wants to consider, given that he still has hopes of landing the title. With just eight games remaining and a significant deficit to make up on Chelsea that looks a forlorn task, but Pellegrini is not giving up. The Chilean said: 'Of course if we want to continue in the first position of the table we must not drop any more points. It is easy to say but not easy to do it. 'We just know that from now until the end of the season we will try to win all the games and we will see if we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end.' Sergio Aguero has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks but will hope to find the net on Monday . James Milner is in line to return after withdrawing from the England squad with a knee problem . City will hope to be at full strength for the trip to Selhurst Park. Pellegrini reported nothing other than 'small problems' when asked about any injury concerns at his pre-match press conference. That means a likely return for key midfielder Yaya Toure, who missed the 3-0 victory over West Brom a fortnight ago with an Achilles problem but has since played for Ivory Coast. Fellow midfielder James Milner has also been troubled by a knee problem in recent weeks - and withdrew from England's midweek friendly in Italy - but the issue is not thought serious.

Radamel Falcao could still sign permanently for Manchester United after it emerged that chief executive Ed Woodward held talks with Monaco on Sunday over the striker’s future. Falcao, who has scored just four times for United since his season-long loan move from Monaco, drew another blank at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea on Saturday evening. But Woodward told Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev last Sunday that they would make a decision on the right to sign him permanently at the end of the season. Manchester United could sign Radamel Falcao permanently after holding talks with Monaco on Sunday . The striker has endured a frustrating season on loan at Man United and has managed just four league goals . Vasilyev said: ‘I saw the Manchester United people last Sunday and they have not yet decided if they would exercise the option.. ‘It’s not his best season, but they kept the opportunity to make a decision at the end of the season.’ Although it seems highly unlikely that United will keep the Colombian striker, Falcao has been given hope of a second chance under Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Under the terms of the original loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the forward, but it has since emerged that Monaco are willing to negotiate on the transfer fee after a disappointing season at United. Vasilyev added: ‘We are not in any other negotiations, even if big clubs are interested. The decision is with Manchester, then we will discuss with the player what he wants. I would like to have more visibility.’ Falcao missed last summer’s World Cup in Brazil following a knee injury and it is thought he rushed his recovery in an attempt to play in the tournament for Colombia. Under the terms of the loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the striker but Monaco are willing to negotiate . Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward spoke with Monaco president Vasim Vasilyev on Sunday . Vasilyev added: ‘He had mishaps in Monaco. He had problems with the coach Claudio Ranieri, there was a lack of understanding. ‘He was also seriously injured and missed the World Cup. In late August, he came to tell us that he wanted to play at a higher level.” Ranieri has since been replaced by Leonardo Jardim and he has backed Falcao to rediscover his goalscoring form after a frustrating season at United. Jardim, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Juventus in the Stade Louis II, is preparing for his return at the end of the season. Jardim, speaking ahead of his side's home clash with Juventus, is confident Falcao can get back to his best . The Portuguese coach said: ‘He’s not had a great season that is true, but I’m sure he can come back to the levels he was at in the past - that much I’m convinced about. ‘It’s not a question for me, but for the players, I’ve only worked with him for a month.’ Monaco lost the first leg last week in the Juventus Stadium to a controversial penalty and face Massimiliano Allegri’s team in the second leg.

An aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed Germanwings passenger plane may had its electronics 'hacked' before it crashed killing all 150 on board. The theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected Financial Times newspaper from aviation boss Matt Andersson, president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace. The French Alps tragedy which occurred on the flight between Barcelona to Dusseldorf has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28. He is believed to have barricaded himself in the cockpit of the GermanWings A320 Airbus before flying the packed plane into the mountainside as the captain fought desperately to get inside. Scroll down for video . Disaster: An aviation expert says an external factor like 'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the Germanwings plane crash that claimed 150 lives . Tragedy: The crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who investigators say locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet . Investigation: But Matt Andersson - president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace - says any number of causes could have caused the crash . Doomed: Recordings from the cockpit suggested that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (left) locked himself in the cockpit while the Captain Patrick Sondenheimer desperately tried to break in . Investigators point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer. Mr Andersson says the French accident investigators are clear that the stricken plane 'accelerated in its descent'. But he writes in the FT: 'That may be, but it could be from any number of causes, including external electronic hacking into the aircraft's control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception.' 'This is one reason military and head-of-state aircraft are generally installed with specific shielding and additional active protective measures,' and he stresses: 'Civilian aircraft are not.' Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries and come to a firm conclusion. He added: 'The public should patiently wait for a through, multi-party professional air safety investigation, while maintaining an independence of judgment over preliminary official hypotheses.' Setting out his doubts about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary findings, Mr Andersson said: 'Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) of the Germanwings flight 9525 have yet to be subject to international standards. 'Until they are, many broad assertions currently presented to the public may turn out to be erroneous, misleading or in some cases lead to improper or counterproductive regulatory and other reactions –including misplaced liability, financial and insurance claims.' Damaged: Despite revelations from the plane's flight data recorders (pictured), Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries . Aftermath: He claims passenger planes do not have the same level of protection as military jets and someone could have hacked into its 'control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception' Since the crash, European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck, requiring a member of cabin crew to step in if one of the two pilots leaves the cockpit. Mr Andersson writes in the FT that the 'slow drip' of piecemeal judgments from preliminary assessments of data can be counterproductive. He said the European Cockpit Association representing nearly 40,000 professional pilots 'has rightly criticised the premature release' of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder. Investigators say this highlights the co-pilot breathing while locked in the cockpit while the pilot beats on the door outside. Protection: Since the crash which is believed to be caused by 28-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck . Police carried out forensic searches on Lubitz's and his parents house after it emerged that he 'deliberately' crashed the Airbus A320 jet into the Alps . He believes premature release 'could arguably prejudice a formal technical assessment' and Mr Andersson is not the only aviation expert to speculate on the plane being 'hacked'. Former commercial pilot Jay Rollins told US television channel MSNBC last month: 'This aircraft is highly computerised. 'There's one possibility that no-one has brought up. I wonder – could this be a hacking incident?' He drew parallels with the loss of a US drone over Iran, which some blamed on electronic hacking: 'Suddenly the aircraft responding to outside forces. 'If something like that were going on it would be very disturbing for the pilot.'

Lindsay Lohan has been living in London for the past year and says she likes it so much, she doesn't see herself returning to the States any time soon. The 28-year-old flame-haired beauty recently spent a stint on the stage, starring in a West End production of David Mamet’s Speed The Plow - for which she received lukewarm reviews - and seems intent on remaining in the UK for the foreseeable future. ‘[London] feels like home, I miss it every time I have to leave for work and can’t wait to get back,’ Lindsay told Homme Style Magazine while posing for a stunning and seductive shoot for the publication. ‘I go back to NYC and LA for family and work.’ Scroll down for video . Staying put: Lindsay Lohan says she feels 'at home' in London and has no plans to return to the States just yet . Fleur Du Mal Leather Corset . Available at Forward by Elyse Walker . Visit site . We haven't heard much from Lindsay in the US since she moved across the pond to London. But if her latest photo shoot for Homme Style magazine is any indication, she's making a comeback in a major way. The Mean Girls star showed of her svelte figure in a series of racy ensembles by Moschino and Agent Provacateur. Here she poses wearing nothing but a Fleur Du Mal leather corset, La Perla panties, and a pair of Moschino gloves. Corsets were hot on the Spring runways at Givenchy and Versace and continue to be a wardrobe staple for sultry celebs like Madonna and Kim Kardashian. Lindsay's leather number is available to purchase for just under $1,000. That's quite a big budget for lingerie, so we've come up with some alternatives that are less pricey but still have major sex appeal.

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same "situations" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'

Designer Lilly Pulitzer's family learned that it's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the 'Pink Sunday' rush for the late Ms Pulitzer’s eponymous brand’s brightly-colored, limited edition collaboration at Target. The 250-piece Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the #LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party .

Protesters have demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons during a protest against the gentrification of South London. The store front of its Brixton branch was covered in shattered glass while 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' was spray painted in black across their housing advertisements. A police spokesman confirmed that one man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Thousands of people turned up for the event organised by the Reclaim Brixton group who were demonstrating against local residents and businesses being priced out of the trendy area. One of the event's organisers denounced the violent actions of 'one idiot' but told MailOnline there could be a reason Foxtons - which has a reputation for selling expensive homes - has been 'continuously targeted'. Scroll down for video . Vandal: One vandal smashed the front window of Foxtons Brixton branch (pictured) during a 'wholly peaceful' protest against rising house prices in London . Violent: The lone protester demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons, who have a reputation for selling expensive houses . Defaced: The vandal then spray painted 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' on the estate agent's housing advertisements . Reputation: A spokesperson for Reclaim Brixton - who organised the event - denounced the man's violent actions but suggested there could be a reason Foxtons is 'continuously targeted' Motive: Cyndi Anaso said she is not happy about the vandalism but told MailOnline 'it suggests there's a reason they are being targeted' Response: Police at the scene in Brixton (pictured) had to us CS spray to disperse a group of violent protesters . Cyndi Anaso from Reclaim Brixton told MailOnline said she was 'saddened' that someone behaved 'deviantly' during a wholly peaceful demonstration. But she claims the upmarket estate agents have been targeted before, adding: 'Foxtons has a very poor reputation when it comes to expensive properties and unfortunately.' 'There's a message in it which I'm not happy about but it still suggests there's a reason they are being targeted. 'There's never an endorsement of the attack but nothing else on the day can be considered even slightly violent.' 'I don't even think it's right to apologise for these individuals because every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window.' Foxtons is widely considered as a sign of gentrification and its presence is an indicates that an area either is or has the potential to become very affluent. The Reclaim Brixton event was planned to demonstrate against the rising property prices in London which the group believes is 'displacing the city's communities'. A statement on the Facebook page for the event said: 'The fight against gentrification starts here! Brixton is widely known for its vibrancy, which is another word for social and cultural diversity. Keeping watch: There is still a 'police presence' outside the vandalised store in Brixton, South London following the incident . Defence: Sympathisers and Brixton locals used Twitter to condemn the attention being given to the 'isolated' act of vandalism . Break-in: The Metropolitan Police (pictured) also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall, but were removed shortly after and no arrests were made . 'But Brixton's vibrancy now has a question mark on it. Will Brixton turn into a living museum or will it live?' But alongside images of people protesting peacefully on the streets, social media has been flooded with images of hordes pushing past police and the Foxtons window being destroyed. A police spokesman added: 'A group of protesters then made their way to Brixton Road where the window of a commercial premises was smashed and graffiti sprayed on the building.' Police used CS spray on 'a small group of protesters' who went into Brixton Police Station at around 4.10pm before being removed shortly afterwards. The Metropolitan Police also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall at around 3.15pm, saying: 'Officers entered the building and the protesters were removed.' Grace Lally from Lambeth Housing Activists said the demonstration had attracted thousands of people. Smashed: A Reclaim Brixton spokesperson said: 'Every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window' She added: 'The protest has been lively and strong and loud and people have hung banners off the town hall, blocked the streets and marched through Brixton a number of times and stopped traffic.' Ms Lally insisted the protest was 'really lively' but there had been 'no violence or trouble or anything like that'. Those sympathetic to Reclaim Brixton's protest and locals of the area have taken to Twitter to denounce isolated incidents of violence. Regarding the smashed window, Vanessa Furey from London said: 'Whilst sympathetic to the sentiment, idiots who have done this will have taken away what Reclaim Brixton was about.' And Louise Ridley wrote: 'I live in Brixton. I want people to know about extortionate rents and evictions. But I don't want windows smashed, anywhere.'

(CNN)Pushed to his limits, a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class. In an email to his students, Irwin Horwitz accused them of "backstabbing, game playing, cheating, lying, fighting." The professor at the Texas A&M University Galveston Campus expected his missive would create some conflict, but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly. Those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage. The story went viral. Suddenly, his name was spreading on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, accompanied by the kind of strong, unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you've never met. He was a hero who taught today's entitled youth a much-needed lesson, or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit. One thing was certain: He, and his employer, were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for. "I did what I did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the Internet," Horwitz said. "I will stand by what I did, but I'm not career suicidal." Texas A&M says Horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching. But Horwitz, a nontenure-track professor in the maritime administration program, is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs. Horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial, and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class. The day before writing to his students, Horwitz wrote a similar email to the CEO of the Texas A&M Galveston Campus and to the school's chief academic officer. "I have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful, dishonest and disrespectful" as his current strategic management class, he wrote to the administrators. He accused the students of shirking responsibility, making excuses and complaining their way to better grades. He would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class, Horwitz wrote. "The class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic," he wrote. "But they are your problem now." It was the next day that Horwitz wrote to the students, calling the class "an embarrassment in general," and said that "I am frankly and completely disgusted." Once his words echoed in traditional and social media, the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone. The story was such a talker that even The Onion offered a parody. "I'm not looking to fail students," Horwitz said. "I don't get a bonus for failing students." "The letter sounded a little bit more definite than I wanted it to," he added. He never actually changed anyone's grade. There were some students he wasn't going to fail, he said, and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out. But Horwitz stands by his tough stance; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed, he said. The course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses. "I had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break-even analysis," the professor said. "If you cannot do a break-even analysis, then you don't deserve a bachelor's degree in business." His other complaint was about professionalism. Horwitz said students would swear at him, cheat and spread rumors about him online. This is related to their grades, he said, because dealing with people you don't like is a business skill. On online message boards, users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story. One purported student called Horwitz "a little obnoxious," but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules. Should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral? The fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public, but maybe there is more to it. The situation hits on a popular argument on the media and Internet: What do we think of millennials? Reflecting on his most recent class, Horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered. He mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics, and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration. The other factor is a failure of K-12 education, said Horwitz, who has met college students who don't know how to convert fractions to decimals. "What I'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance," he said. In a statement, Patrick Louchouarn, the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at Texas A&M Galveston Campus, said the entire class will not be failed. "Each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester," Louchouarn said. "The university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies." The flurry of attention is unwelcome and Horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia. But it's likely his story will have a short shelf life. People probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline. But he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere. He said he feels a public shaming of sorts. Online public shaming has become a research topic of its own. People who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance. "This is really destroying my life," Horwitz said.

A northern Indiana pizzeria that closed after its owner said his religious beliefs wouldn't allow him to cater a gay wedding opened Thursday to a full house of friends, regulars and people wanting to show their support. 'It's a relief to get going again and try to get back to normal,' said Kevin O'Connor, owner of Memories Pizza. O'Connor closed the shop for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana. Scroll down for video . Full house: Many customers wait for service as Memories Pizza reopened for business on Thursday. A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours . Owner Kevin O'Connor closed the shop (seen on Tuesday)  for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law . O'Connor, the  61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming . O'Connor said the criticism hasn't changed his beliefs. He said gays are welcome in his restaurant in the small, one-traffic-light town of Walkerton, 20 miles southwest of South Bend, but that he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his Christian beliefs. 'I'd do the same thing again. It's my belief. It's our belief. It's what we grew up on,' he said. 'I'm just sorry it comes to this because neither one of us dislike any of those people. I don't hold any grudges.' A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours. O'Connor said he hasn't received the money yet, but said he plans to give some to charity and use some money to make improvements to the restaurant. The 61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. 'I enjoy it. I don't want to leave here,' he said. 'I want this to be something that my daughter can enjoy.' Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming. Anger: A protester is seen outside Memories Pizza in this photo with a sign that reads 'Bigots' Uproar: Protesters (like the ones seen here on March 28) have been upset over Indiana passing a new law, which critics said allows businesses the ability to refuse service to gay customers on religious grounds. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana . Family: O'Connor, seen with his daughter Crystal, says gays are welcome in his restaurant, but he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his beliefs . The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. O'Connor says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders . 'We were like, `Stop! Stop! Stop!'" she said. 'It was really making us uncomfortable,' her father said. The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. He says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders. There were no protests as of 7 p.m. Jeanne and Ken Gumm from outside LaPorte, about 20 miles northwest of Walkerton, said they had been waiting for the pizzeria to reopen so they could show their support. 'We couldn't wait to get down here," said Ken Gumm, 66, a tank truck driver. 'To us this whole thing isn't about gay marriage. It's mostly about freedom of religion.'

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today left the door open to a second referendum on Scottish independence before 2020. Before last year's historic vote, Scottish nationalists insisted it was a once-in-a-generation chance to decided on the future of the 300-year-old Union. But Ms Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' In September's vote, 55 per cent of Scots backed the idea of remaining in the United Kingdom. Alex Salmond said the vote was an 'opportunity of a lifetime' and two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: 'We have always said it's a once in a generation thing.' But in a series of TV election debates between Scottish leaders, Ms Sturgeon has shifted her position and today left open the possibility that the promise of another vote could be included in a future SNP manifesto. Under pressure she said that 'something would have to change' before she promised a referendum, and people would have to vote for it. She said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, there is not another referendum on the cards. 'In order for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future, something significant would have to change from the situation we had last year in the referendum.' Ms Sturgeon, who was campaigning in Paisley today, left open the idea of demanding a referendum in next year's Scottish Parliament elections . Opponents claim Ms Sturgeon had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on a referendum, after insisting last year's vote was a once in a generation event . During a fractious and at times shouty debate on BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged her to rule out another vote. Ms Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: 'You clearly don't want to tell people before they vote in this election, what will happen in the next election. 'You have a conference coming up in September, you have 80,000 new members who might be popping along, are you going to put a motion at your conference on this to put a referendum into your next manifesto?' Ms Sturgeon said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, I haven't published the 2016 manifesto. It will be this time next year before we publish the 2016 one.' Mr Rennie said the SNP leader had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on another referendum. He said: 'People need to know whether their vote for the SNP this time round will trigger a referendum in the SNP's manifesto in 2016. Nicola Sturgeon's refusal to answer this basic question makes clear that Scotland faces neverendum. 'It matters because during the referendum we know the SNP took their eye off the ball. As a result, public services were neglected. 'We have seen from Canada the economic impact of an uncertain constitutional environment. Quebec lost jobs and wealth. That damaged the province in the long term. I want a Scotland which builds a stronger economy and a fairer society, balancing the books and delivering more powers.' During a TV debate, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged Ms Sturgeon to come clean on her plans for Scotland . Ms Sturgeon later accused her opponents of 'reviving Project Fear'. The First Minister was questioned about SNP plans to increase Scotland's financial powers, which economists have suggested would leave a £7.6 billion spending gap, during a third televised election debate in under a week. Ms Sturgeon said that full fiscal autonomy would take several years to implement but with new powers Scotland would start growing its economy and revenues. She said: 'This week we've seen the Project Fear that dominated the referendum revived by these three unionist parties, trying to talk down Scotland and assert that we're not capable of running our own affairs.' Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said: 'This (the figure) didn't come from us. You're right in saying this came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It also came from a group of Scottish-based economists that projected the gap to be bigger.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: 'To make this £7.6 billion up Scotland would have to grow at twice the rate of the rest of entire advanced world, so how would you do that Nicola?'

A night of violence gave way to a day of mourning Sunday for a man who died after sustaining serious injuries while in the custody of Baltimore police. Over several hours on Sunday afternoon, a steady stream of mourners filed into the Vaughn Green East funeral home for a wake for Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who died a week after an encounter with police left him with grave spinal injuries.

Above the lid to the coffin was a floral arrangement and inside the lid was a pillow with a screen-printed picture of Gray flanked by doves and the quote, 'Peace, Y'all' at the bottom edge. Mourners also gathered outside. Some held up signs that read, 'We remember Freddie' and 'Our Hearts Are With The Gray Family.' Melissa McDonald, 36, who said she was Gray's cousin, wore a shirt with 'Freddie Forever' printed on the back. She described her cousin as a nonviolent person. 'He didn't deserve to die the way he did,' she said. A number of mourners like Tina Covington, 46, said they didn't know the family but came to express their condolences. Covington said she has a son near Freddie Gray's age. Gray was detained on April 12 after he ran away from police. He asked for an inhaler as he screamed in pain during the arrest and requested medical attention, but was denied . Gray, who was arrested for carrying a switchblade knife, died a week after the incident from a severed spine . 'It hits home. It really does. It's a reality check,' said Covington, whose son is 27. Covington said that 'there is something going on in the police department that needs to change.' Gray's funeral is planned for Monday. At a church service earlier Sunday, Pastor Jamal Bryant told churchgoers, including members of Gray's family, at Empowerment Temple AME Church that 'somebody is going to have to pay' for Gray's death.

Roughly 1,200 protesters gathered at City Hall on Saturday afternoon, officials said, to protest Gray's death, which has prompted near-daily demonstrations since he died April 19. Gray was arrested one week before that when officers chased him through a West Baltimore neighborhood and dragged him into a police van. However, a smaller group splintered off and looted a convenience store and smashed storefront windows. A protester tossed a flaming metal garbage can toward police officers in riot gear trying to push back the crowd. Earlier, a group of protesters smashed windows of at least three police cars. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a long-time congressman representing Baltimore's 7th District, told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that there is deep frustration over the case. 'Mr. Gray died a week ago. And I think the thing that upset so many people was the fact that here's a young man. We still don't know exactly why he was arrested,' Cummings said. 'We do know that he was hollering out for aid. He was not given aid after being arrested. ... A lot of people are very, very frustrated as to trying to figure out what happened here, and it's very upsetting.'

Police acknowledged Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested — before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the Police Department's policy. Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray asked for medical help several times, beginning before he was placed in the van. After a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.

A volleyball-playing feline was picked to star in a national TV advert after seeing off competition from thousands of gifted animals. Tortoiseshell Mimi became an internet sensation after her owner uploaded clips of her playing the sport to Facebook. The 30-second-video was shared by thousands of people around the world and features the one-year-old cat playing with 15-year-old Joshua Teague. Joshua’s dad Phil, 56, a computer programmer, bought the cat with his wife Christine, 45, when she was eight-weeks-old in December 2013 from a seller who lived in Birmingham. Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert, which was broadcast last Wednesday (15), after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group earlier this month. He said: 'All the family were really excited to see the advert. Mimi the cat appears in a 30-second video showing her unique ball skills . 'We had everyone around so we could watch it together and we told all our friends that it was going to be on. 'I am really proud that our video was chosen out of thousands of entries. 'It was completely by chance that I uploaded the video on to the Pets At Home Facebook page. The cat is seen playing volleyball with 15-year-old Joshua Teague in the hallway . Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group . 'I just saw something on there asking people to share videos and pictures of their pets so that’s what I did. I didn’t even realise it was a competition. 'The video showed Mimi playing volleyball with my son where he would throw the ball at her and she would keep batting it back. 'I had no idea it was competition so I thought it was a joke when I received an email on April 1 saying our video had been chosen for a national commercial. Mimi is seen in the video batting the ball back to Joshua every time he throws it her way . 'This kind of thing just never happens. 'She is a very talented cat. She has done many times since. 'I think she could get her own TV show.' Administrative assistant Christine said: 'I didn’t even know Phil had uploaded the video on Facebook so I thought it was an April Fools’ joke when he told me about it. 'We normally just skip the adverts when we watch programmes but we made sure to watch this one. 'Although she’s only in the advert for a few seconds, it’s nice to see her on it. 'I never thought when I filmed the video that it would end up on TV.'

Controversial Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans is under attack again with experts warning his 'reworked' baby milk formula is dangerous to babies. Dietitians have singled out a 'happy tummy brew' in Evans' cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, because it contains almost five times the maximum vitamin A dose for a baby. The original recipe for the 'brew' contained more than 10 times the maximum daily intake of vitamin A for babies. Scroll down for video . The paleo diet has been one of the hottest diet trends around, with celebrity followers taking on the lifestyle . The Dieticians Association of Australia said the reworked formula still presents a threat to babies. 'This new infant 'brew' could seriously harm babies,' a spokeswoman for the Dieticians Association of Australia told News Corp Australia. 'The authors seem to have made a serious mistake with this second version of their liver and broth recipe, suggesting they do not understand the basic scientific and nutrition information relevant for infant feeding. 'They have said publicly that they have tried to make it safe by reworking the original recipe, and increasing the age for which it's suggested from 0-6 months to now be 6-12 months, but they have failed spectacularly to meet any safe standards.' The paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle . Evans's co-authors, wellness blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padrin, told Channel 7 last week the dangerous formula had been reworked and renamed 'Happy Tummy Brew'. The pair told the program the recipe had changed. 'We added vitamin C and some calcium,'Carr told The Morning Show. It comes after Evans' recently shared two stories on his social media accounts of women who claimed the paleo diet helped alleviate the symptoms of their multiple sclerosis. A 30-year-old woman, Hollie, wrote she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in September 2013. She said that she endured months of  constant dizziness, altered temperature perception, extreme fatigue, numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression. But after jumping on the Paleo diet bandwagon, Hollie claimed she has not suffered any MS symptoms over the past 12 months, her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever. Hollie's experience led the celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000-plus followers on Facebook on Saturday. Pete Evans has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis . 'WOW this is powerful story on MS, thanks for sharing Hollie.. it will make your heart sing.. it has mine, please tag and share wide!' Evans wrote. The Australian chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg, another MS sufferer. The woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on Evans' 10 weeks Paleo program. The celebrity chef has been a proud paleo advocate . 'I have had a lot of health issues the past years, mainly auto-immune stuff including MS,' she wrote in the online post. 'Having MS means I'm always sapped of energy, have numbness, pins and needles, pain, poor concentration, etc. Not any more!' Marg said she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs. 'No way on earth I could have done that 10 weeks ago,' she wrote. 'My concentration and memory is much better and I can also plan better. I'm not off my MS meds yet but I am off my Thyroid and Reflux meds. 'Thanks so much Pete and team for helping me get my life back. You've made this road so easy. As an added bonus I've gone from a size 16 to a size 12.' The My Kitchen Rules judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy. But, Hollie praised Evans for his endorsement of the controversial diet, and said 'the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable'. 'I have been inspired by your encouragement, great recipes and educated by the accurate information you provide,' Hollie wrote. 'Pete, I thank you so very much for bringing paleo in to the mainstream - people no longer look at me as though I'm a weirdo for following this way of life.' In another recent Facebook post, the Australian chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg who also suffers from MS . Evans has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman 'diet' LaTrobe University Associate Professor of Dietetics Catherine Itsiopoulos pointed out Hollie's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the Paleo lifestyle. 'Her diet may have been poor previously,' Dr Itsiopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we don't know what her diet and eating habits were like before. 'By eating lean meat, good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together. 'But we don't actually know if her condition is cured so it's hard to advocate on because there's no scientific evidence to back this up.' The paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar . University of South Australia Professor of Population, Health and Nutrition Kerin O'Dea said while the diet seemed to have worked for Hollie, it might not work for others. 'Pete can share whatever he likes to his followers but there's never going to be one magic bullet to cure an illness or a serious disease,' Dr O'Dea told Daily Mail Australia. 'Someone reporting an anecdote might be true in one person's case but it's very difficult to imply it to others, which can be quite misleading for people. The paleo style of eating, which Pete Evans is a proud supporter of, has been sweeping across the globe . 'They could feel failure when it doesn't work for them, especially when they try to cure a serious condition like this. 'I wouldn't recommend any particular diet for anyone suffering any type of illnesses.' The paleo style of eating, which Evans is a proud supporter of, has swept  the globe and involves a high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruits, seeds and nuts.

(CNN)A popular Chinese television host known for impromptu satire is now the subject of controversy after being caught on camera cursing the late Chairman Mao Zedong. Bi Fujian, who works for state-run China Central Television, was filmed at a dinner party singing a revolutionary song that eulogizes the Communist Party's early years when he started going off script. "The Communist Party, Chairman Mao. Don't mention that old son of a b***h. He made us suffer so bad," went Bi's improvised lyrics. The other dinner guests burst into laughter. Bi later apologized. "My personal speech has led to grave social consequences, and I feel remorseful for that. I hereby sincerely apologize to the public. As a public figure, I shall learn the lesson from this incident, adhering to strict self-discipline," he posted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform. Making disrespectful references to China's leaders in public is considered a taboo in China, even today. And Bi's comment was directed at the man regarded by many as the country's founding father -- despite his controversial reputation. The 75-second video clip, seemingly filmed on the cellphone of another dinner guest, was uploaded on Monday. Since then, it has been removed from video-sharing sites inside China, although it was still accessible on Weibo. It's unclear when the incident occurred, or what the relationsip was between the camera person and Bi. CCTV said it would investigate. "As a CCTV presenter, Bi Fujian's speech in the online video has led to grave social consequences," the network said in a statement posted on its Weibo account. CCTV did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Fondly known as "Grandpa Bi," the 56-year-old TV personality was born and grew up in the Mao era. The song Bi riffed on was part of a "red" Peking opera that was first performed in the late 1950s. It was popularized during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s -- which was launched by Mao -- when China was torn apart by violence and social unrest. The video quickly divided China's online community. Critics said Bi, as an influential public figure, deserved a harsh punishment. But others rushed to his defense, arguing that Bi was simply enjoying himself in a private setting and was set up by whoever uploaded the clip. The video also emerged just a day before the new head of CCTV started his job, leading some to wonder if it were a case of "a new broom sweeps clean." Mao still divides opinion in China. His giant portrait hangs on Beijing's Tiananmen Gate, and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital. But despite this reverence, Mao's is a deeply flawed legacy. Many remember him as a brutal dictator who inspired fear, paranoia and famine, and whose actions resulted in tens of millions of deaths. CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report.

A man vying to become the next Kentucky governor has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after a late local celebrity who bid five times for the title but never won enough votes. The 68-year-old Pulaski County resident, who was known as Terrill Wayne Newman until Tuesday, told the Lexington Herald-Leader he doesn't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will 'warm Galbraith's grave.' His predecessor, who died in 2012 from chronic emphysema, gained a following for his wit, sharp dress sense and support of legalizing marijuana. Terrill Wayne Newman (right), who is vying to become Governor of Kentucky, has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after the late local celebrity (left) who bid five times for the title but never won . The newly-christened Galbraith filed paperwork on Wednesday to run as an independent for the state's highest office. The Secretary of State's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by August 11 to get their names on the general election ballot. Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said. Galbraith says he and the late Galbraith were 'not friends per se,' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis. Dea Riley, who was the original Galbraith's running mate in 2011, said she thinks he would find the whole name change amusing. 'I can hear him now: "I'll tell the IRS to send him the tax bill,"' Riley said. But she also said the new Galbraith 'has very big shoes to fill' with his name and she hopes he will honor it. 'To have Gatewood's name and message prostituted, for the sake to garner political office, is a personal affront to me in that I was not only his running mate but equally his friend and confidant,' Riley said.

The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted. Barcelona star duo Luis Suarez (right) and Lionel Messi embrace as Barcelona take a seven-point lead in La Liga . The Barcelona No 10 loses his markers in the Almeria penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike . Barcelona talisman Messi wheels away after opening the scoring  at the Nou Camp during a 4-0 victory over Almeria . Suarez followed Messi's lead by scoring a similar left-footed strike to double the Catalans lead with the first of his two goals . Barcelona defender Marc Bartra stuffs the ball under his shirt after netting a third with a headed goal on 75minutes . Barcelona (4-3-3): Bravo; Alves, Bartra, Mascherano, Adriano; Sergi Roberto, Xavi, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Pedro. Subs: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Mathieu, Pique, Iniesta, Rafinha, Neymar . Booked: Mascherano . Scorer: Messi 33', Suarez 55', Bartra 75', Suarez 90' Almeria (4-2-3-1): Julian; Ximo Navarro, Marin, Trujillo, Casado; Partey, Corona; Wellington Silva (Soriano), Espinosa (Mane), Edgar (Zongo); Bifouma. Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Julián Cuesta in the visitors’ goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Barça number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta’s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo’s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta’s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes. Almeria keeper Julian Cuesta uses any means necessary to keep the ball away from former Liverpool forward Luis Suarez (left) Barcelona stalwart Xavi (right) watches on as team-mate Messi tries a rare attempt using his head . Spain international Pedro (centre) was given an opportunity after Neymar was dropped to the bench to cope with hectic schedule . Everyone on the pitch can only watch as Messi's stunning left-foot strike curls into the bottom corner of the net . Brazil full-back Dani Alves rushes to congratulate team-mate Messi after he gives Barcelona a first half lead . The Argentina phenomenon celebrates scoring his 33rd league goal of the season so far . Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria’s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona’s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury. If they don’t do you with the magic of Messi and Suarez then they do you from a dead ball. Almeria had succumbed to all three threats.

Sandra Garratt was in constant agony after undergoing two operations before her death . A grandmother racked with constant pain jumped from the top of a multi-storey car park to end her suffering, her devastated husband has said. Sandra Garratt, 56, went through two years of agony following two back operations for a slipped disc and not even morphine could dull the pain. Last month doctors told the housewife there was nothing more they could do ease her suffering and this was the 'final straw', according to her husband Steve. On Good Friday, the mother of two left her home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after telling her husband she was 'just popping out'. But he became anxious for her welfare and he called the police. At 2.35pm, police and ambulance crews were called to the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, where they discovered Mrs Garratt's body. She had fallen more than 50ft from the top of an Asda supermarket multi-storey car park. Mr Garratt, 57, told how he gave up his job as a community transport driver last year to care for his wife. He said her suffering had intensified in the last 18 months of her life and the pain had spread to her legs, feet and fingers. He added: 'She was in pain every minute of every day. She was a happy lovely person but withdrew from her happy family life. 'Before there had been hope but when there was nothing they could do, it was the final straw. 'Everybody says the same – she is now free from the pain. That's the only bit of comfort. 'The doctors and GPs, within the scope of the NHS waiting lists and everything that goes on, did everything they could.' Mrs Garratt leaves behind daughter Lucy, 37, son Jonathan, 26, and two grandchildren, Joshua and Jessica. The coroner has been informed of her death. Mrs Garratt told her husband she was 'popping out' on Good Friday. Hours later her body was found at the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, West Midlands .

A young Star Wars fan, who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies’ creator George Lucas asking whether he would allow Jedi Knights to marry in the future, was elated to receive a reply granting his request. Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric told Inside Edition: 'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy was on hand to film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son, who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It’s very black and white. There’s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don’t have emotions, but they do. It’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'

The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 at auction. The unique psychedelic cartoon, which is hand-painted, depicts the eponymous submarine from the 1968 film in which the Fab Four travel to Pepperland to save it from the Blue Meanies. The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas, Texas, on Thursday . The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the Yellow Submarine film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The 1968 film starred The Beatles (above) It features handwritten notes instructing artists on the correct colours to use when recreating the submarine. More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch £10,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time. Yellow Submarine was a success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album a year later . The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. The original cel is set to sell for £10,000 . 'It is a film that has stood the test of time and is as relevant today as when it was made in 1968. The Band Concert is the most expensive cel sold . The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported £280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference. 'It would be one of the earliest final versions of the Yellow Submarine hand-painted - it really is the holy grail of Yellow Submarine memorabilia. 'Since small stickers were used for when the sub travelled there are not really a great deal of Yellow Submarine cels out there. 'This comes from a former Yellow Submarine ink and paint department employee. 'It is an unusually large image. Colour model cels were used also to help determine the final approved colour scheme of the yellow submarine. 'Colour model cels from this film are very rare, and this is one of the single best cels of the Yellow Submarine we have seen.' The Animation Art Signature Auction will take place in Dallas, Texas on April 9.

A terminally-ill landlord whose dying wish was to marry his partner of 26 years saw their special day descend into farce after a series of blunders. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home. But, instead of having the magical day they had planned, the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly. Guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over, and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather, 54, after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple's special day (pictured) was full of blunders . Guests at the couple's (pictured) wedding were forced to listen to the song 'Wonderful Life' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on, rendering it invalid . Mr Haigh, who died weeks after the ceremony in November last year, was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he'd let her down. In fact, the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House in the city centre, where the pair said their vows. Mrs Haigh, 54, said: 'Geoff was heartbroken by it all. He kept apologising to me and saying he'd wished we'd got married years earlier and done it properly. 'He was devastated, as the way he saw it, this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness.' The couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once Mr Haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal. However, the landlord of The Ram's Head pub, in Oldham, was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely. The pair then settled upon the Manchester venue as it was not too far from their home. It took three people two hours to get Mr Haigh ready for his big day and, determined to make the day perfect for his bride-to-be, he battled through pain to make it to the venue. Mrs Haigh, 54, said every guest at the ceremony -  held in November last year in Manchester  -  wrote a letter of complaint. She has three marriage certificates (pictured) as the first two were riddled with errors . The couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony (pictured) and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date. An amended version posted later was full spelling errors . However, it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began. They said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down. Then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows, which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar. Mrs Haigh, a mother of three, said: 'There was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after I asked I was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day. Geoff Haigh and his wife Heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day. 'It felt like they were merely using us a practice go, like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them.' After the bride and groom said their vows, guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music 'Wonderful Life' while the registrar went out of the room. Unbelievably, almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before Mrs Haigh was compelled to take action. She said: 'Everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on. We couldn't believe it. 'It had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now.' After the ceremony, as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant San Carlos, the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate. They were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected, otherwise their marriage was invalid. Mrs Haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead. However, when the second certificate arrived in the post, it was addressed to Mrs Haigh in her maiden name 'Taylor' and included spelling errors on the document. A third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple. Mr Haigh (above) passed away in January this year, just weeks after his wedding to long-term partner Heather. The couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year . Mrs Haigh (left) said her new husband (right) was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down. She has received £137 from the Manchester register office following the calamity day . Mrs Haigh said: 'It felt like they didn't recognise we were married and that really hurt Geoff before he died. 'It made if feel like the whole thing didn't happen, like it meant nothing at all. It was devastating. 'The guests were all in tears for us. They were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously.' The newlyweds were offered a £137 refund but Mrs Haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough 'loss' to warrant compensation. She said: 'It wasn't about the money, but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband. 'It was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more. They said "we all make mistakes and we are only human". 'That's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man's dying wish and the most special day of our lives, that attitude is not acceptable.' The wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House (pictured)  in the city centre, where the pair said their vows . The family has since received an apology from Manchester City Council, which runs the register office based at Heron House. A spokesman said: 'I'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs Taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations. 'These types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious. They understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding.' However, tragically, Mr Haigh died on January 4 this year before receiving the apology. His wife added: 'Geoff was determined not to die over Christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come, and he didn't want that for us. The energy it took from him to hang on, I couldn't believe.'

Washington (CNN)This week is the 100th anniversary of what many historians acknowledge as the Armenian genocide -- the Turkish massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians . And it's also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word "genocide" to describe the atrocity. It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word "genocide" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a "genocide" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago . In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. "The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence," he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. "We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians . In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. "No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on," she wrote.

Jailed millionaire Robert Durst pleaded not guilty Tuesday to the newest charge against him - a federal charge of possessing a gun after a felony conviction. U.S. District Judge Lance Africk set a trial date for June 22. Durst is an estranged member of the wealthy family that operates 1 World Trade Center. He also faces a murder charge in California and two state weapons charges in Louisiana - one of possessing a .38-caliber revolver after a felony conviction and one of possessing the firearm along with an illegal drug: about 5 ounces of marijuana. Claiming innocence: Suspected murderer Robert Durst appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to a new charge of gun possession. Pictured above leaving federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana in handcuffs after the court appearance . Durst pleaded guilty to two federal charges in Pennsylvania in 2004: possessing a firearm while a fugitive and while under indictment. However, his lawyers say those convictions don't make it illegal for him to carry a gun under Louisiana law. The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of 55-year-old Susan Berman, a longtime friend -allegedly because she was going to talk to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. He was arrested early March 15, less than 12 hours before HBO aired the final segment of 'The Jinx,' in which - off camera in a bathroom but with the microphone still live - Durst whispers, 'There it is. You're caught!' After about 10 other short sentences and disjointed phrases, he says, 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' Durst was arrested last month on suspicion of the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. The two pictured together above . It's believed that Durst killed Berman because she was about to speak to investigators about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife Kathleen McCormack. Pictured together above . Tuesday's hearing had its own bizarre moment when prosecutor Mike McMahon asked Durst if he understood the maximum penalties he faced if convicted. Durst responded: 'And you are?' Durst's attorney and the judge then explained to him who McMahon was. Durst is being held without bail in a state prison where the Orleans Parish mental ward is located, because the sheriff's office says experts found him a suicide risk. Defense attorneys and prosecutors met with a different federal judge last week to discuss another federal matter: whether two FBI agents and a state trooper on an FBI task force should be held in contempt of court for failing to show up at a hearing last week before the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court magistrate. Federal prosecutors moved that part of the case to federal court Monday; Durst's attorneys have not filed their response and have said they would not comment until they do. Durst's lawyers say his arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the conclusion of 'The Jinx.' Durst had registered at the Marriott under the name Everette Ward and was lying low while HBO aired the final chapter of his life story. Authorities said they found a passport, a head-and-chest latex mask, a handgun and marijuana in his room. His lawyers say it was searched illegally.

A Montana judge who was censured by the state's high court for his comments about a 14-year-old rape victim has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that former state District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors. Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher. Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. At Rambold's August 2013 sentencing, Baugh said Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold, the Billings Gazette reported at the time. Baugh, per the newspaper, described the teenage girl as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth. Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. Scroll down for video . Selected: Former District Judge G. Todd Baugh has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. He sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that a 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher . Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence. Legal case: Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez (right) shared some responsibility for her rape by teacher Stacey Rambold (left) Baugh, who served almost 30 years as a state judge, stepped down last year after being censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days. He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he didn't know who nominated him for the achievement award. He also repeated his assertion that media reports about the rape case had not told the whole story. 'I'm not trying to say I didn't make any mistakes. If you go into all the mistakes that were made, it would give a better-balanced report,' Baugh said. Fehr said Baugh had been nominated for the award by members of the bar association, but she declined to say who that was or why he was chosen. Case: Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence . Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. Baugh later apologized for his remarks. He was also censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days . Marian Bradley, Northwest regional director for the National Organization for Women, said the award was inappropriate given Baugh's conduct on the bench. Regardless of his prior accomplishments, Bradley said the Rambold case cannot be overlooked. 'The last chapter in his career, he put himself out there and did not protect a young girl and did not protect a community,' Bradley said. 'Giving him a lifetime achievement award is going to send people into tailspins.' Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. In December, state District Judge Russell Fagg wrote in a column for the Billings Gazette that Baugh handled more than 30,000 cases in his career. 'He has made thousands of good calls, and a few bad calls, as have all of us,' Fagg wrote. 'Bottom line: Baugh is a wonderful person.'

Kelly Ripa has been grief stricken following the sad news that her friend, cosmetic surgeon Dr Fredric Brandt, was found dead by suicide at his Miami mansion on Sunday. So it's understandable that 44-year-old TV star was looking morose as she left her New York City apartment on Tuesday. The Live With Kelly & Michael co-host, who is usually seen smiling, wore a frown as she left the building alone. When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life.' Sad day: Kelly Ripa looked to be in mourning on Tuesday as she left her NYC apartment; on Sunday it was announced her surgeon friend Dr Fredric Brandt had died . The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice.' The former soap opera actress was dressed casually in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on. The beauty was carrying her coat as well as some papers, a cell phone and her purse. Casual look: The former soap opera actress was dressed down in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on . Feeling the pain: On her show Live With Kelly & Michael, the host told Michael Strahan that she will miss the doctor who had worked on the morning program . Near tears: When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life' Heartfelt: The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice' The day before the New Yorker tweeted her condolences for Dr Brandt, 65, who was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry.  Madonna and Stephanie Seymour were clients. 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer,' the star wrote. Her husband Mark Consuelos, retweeted choreographer Isaac Calpito's post, which read: 'Devastated over the loss of our dear friend @drfredricbrandt. You are missed. You are loved. The world has lost one of its kindest souls.' They were close: Dr  Brandt was remembered by  Ripa (left with the surgeon in 2011) in a tweet on Monday following his tragic suicide at his Miami home on Sunday . Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.' The City of Miami Police Department confirmed that Dr Brandt's death on Sunday was a suicide by hanging. An autopsy was scheduled on Monday, the coroner confirmed. Miami Herald columnist, Lesley Abravanel had said Brandt had been 'devastated' recently over rumors comparing him to a character on the Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Her note: The 44-year-old beauty's tweet said, 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer' Abravanel, a Miami Herald columnist, posted a series of tweets on Sunday claiming that he had been 'devastated' by unflattering comparisons to Dr Franff on the  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, according to  sources close to the doctor. The doctor's longtime publicist Jacquie Tractenberg told The New York Post on Monday: 'The show definitely deeply hurt him, he was being made fun of because of the way he looks. 'It is mean, and it was bullying. But the show was not the reason for his depression, and it was not the reason he would take his own life.' The Tractenberg & Co PR agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. Was he bullied?: Dr  Brandt (left) has a resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly 'devastated' by the portrayal . His colleague, Dr Robert Anolik, who worked with Brandt at his practice, posted a moving tribute on Monday. The acclaimed dermatologist wrote: 'Dr. Fredric Brandt died yesterday. For nearly 5 years, Fred and I worked side by side. He was far more than a colleague to me. He was a close friend. I will miss him every day.' The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami by his housekeeper where he lived alone. She called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. The New York Post also wrote a column last month comparing the real-life doctor to the fictional doctor on Tina Fey's hit comedy. 'Sources: Dr Fredric Brandt was "devastated" over comparisons to the protagonist on Tina Fey’s new Netflix show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt",' Abravanel tweeted. Behar tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed' An eye for art: Dr Brandt, a cosmetic dermatologist and well-known art collector pictured in front of a piece from his collection at his apartment in New York City on March 7, 2014 . Dr Franff only appears in one episode, titled 'Kimmy Goes To The Doctor!', of the first season. The character shares Dr Brandt’s smooth skin, platinum blond hair and enthusiasm for plastic surgery, but his door sign claims he’s a ‘board certified D, DS, DDSOBGYN’, rather than a cosmetic dermatologist. The Dr Franff character is depicted on the Netflix show with a high-pitched laugh and unable to speak certain words due to his plastic surgery. He is also seen drinking  from a surgical bag and reinflates his own face after being punched. Netflix had no comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy.

Moscow (CNN)A Russian TV channel aired Hillary Clinton's first campaign video with a rating stamp that means it's for mature audiences, because of fears it might run afoul of the country's anti-gay propaganda law. A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. "There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't," a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. "Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video)." Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, "I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about." The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that "gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights." Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as "a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia." Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. "I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them," Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). "We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone," he said before the 2014 Games. "That's why you can feel safe and free here," he added, "but please leave our children in peace." The rights group ILGA-Europe said in a May 2014 report that Russia was the worst place in Europe (out of 49 countries) for LGBTI people to live.

A Pennsylvania couple have been killed after their 1923 Model T Ford convertible skidded off the roadway and flipped over. Ralph Cramer, 70, and his wife, Lynn, 59, were returning home from the Creekside Café in Mount Joy at about 9 p.m. on Sunday when the accident occurred.

Manheim Borough Police Chief Joseph Stauffer told Lancaster Online that the vehicle left the road, flipped over and landed upside-down in a ditch. It was not immediately known who was driving or if the couple had worn seat belts. The top was down when the wreck occurred. Stauffer says there's evidence the vehicle started to skid at a slight left turn, then went off the road and hit an embankment near a barn. The vehicle had been rebuilt or restored, with new elements. 'There are no indicators of what caused the accident yet,' said Stauffer. The investigation continues and Manheim police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

(CNN)A French-language global television network regained control of one of its 11 channels Thursday after a cyberattack a day earlier crippled its broadcasts and social media accounts. Television network TV5Monde was gradually regaining control of its channels and social media outlets after suffering what the network's director called an "extremely powerful cyberattack." In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. On a mobile site, which was still active, the network said it was "hacked by an Islamist group." ISIS logos and markings appeared on  TV5Monde social media accounts. But there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group. As day broke Thursday in Europe, the network had regained the use of one of its 11 channels and its Facebook page, Paul Germain, the chain's editor in chief, told BFMTV, a CNN affiliate in France. However, by late morning, a number of pages on the network's website had messages saying they were under maintenance. The outage began around 8:45 p.m. Paris time (2:45 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. TV5Monde offers round-the-clock entertainment and news programming that reaches 260 million homes worldwide, according to the Ministry of Culture and Communications. It functions under a partnership among the governments of France, Canada and Switzerland, as well as the Wallonia-Brussels Federation. Other networks that provide content to TV5Monde include CNN affiliates France 2 and France 3, France 24 and Radio France International.

A singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner. Captured in a front room in Bahama, North Carolina, the three dogs – a Husky called Sky, a brown and white Springer Spaniel called Sadie and a black and white Springer Spaniel called Marshall – take their positions on their make-shift stage. Getting the tune underway, Sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on Sky’s ear as if whispering something – Sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction. The video begins with Sadie the Springer Spaniel barking and interacting with the Husky named Sky . The Springer Spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the Husky joins it, but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl. Following the Husky’s lead, the Spring Spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another. Meanwhile the other Springer Spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner. No, it's like this! The Husky begins howling, causing the Springer Spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead . All together now! The three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony . Before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl, which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo. The trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder. The howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs – who continue to wag their tails – showing any signs of letting up. No encore? The owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise . Eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying: ‘Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.’ And the three dogs, rather put out about being interrupted, stopping and turning to look at him in surprise.

Kuyt signed a one-year contract with Feyenoord, who are currently third in the top-flight Eredivisie, but said his stay will likely be longer. Kuyt grew into a favorite among Feyenoord's fanatical fans during his first stint with the club from 2003-2006, after transferring from Utrecht. He was the Eredivisie's top scorer in the 2004-2005 season and was named Dutch footballer of the year in 2006. Dirk Kuyt (left) is returning to Feyenoord, nine years after leaving the Dutch Eredivsie club for Liverpool . Kuyt retired from international football in October after finishing third with the Netherlands at last year's World Cup - a tournament where he underscored his versatility by playing on the wing and at left back. He made 104 appearances for the Netherlands and scored 24 goals. He also was part of the team that finished second in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, losing to Spain in the final.

While it might be the nation's largest grocer, Walmart Supercenter was ranked at the bottom of the barrel  in a recent survey of America's supermarkets. The retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in Consumer Reports' annual survey, and this year it was rated number 67, the second worst supermarket. As it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine, Walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce. However, it was noted for its better-than-average prices. Walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in Consumer Reports' annual supermarket survey . The retailer (above a worker in the produce section of a Walmart in Miama) came in at number 67 followed by chain Waldbaum's, which was in last place . 'Every store I go in has room to improve,' said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a statement that the company released to Consumer Reports. 'I can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better. 'And if we nail those, one store at a time, our short-term performance gets better.' The respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness, food quality, freshness and staff courtesy. Walmart was joined by A&P (rated number 66) and Waldbaum's (number 68), which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed, according to CBS. The annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts, which was cited by a quarter of respondents. Other findings included: . Source: Consumer Reports . America's favorite supermarket, taking first place, is New York-based Wegmans. The retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness, baked goods and overall shopping experience. Publix came in second place followed by Trader Joe's, Fareway Stores and Market Basket. Wegmans was also among a total of three grocers, including Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, that earned outstanding produce scores. 'It's going to sound cliché, but our employees are our secret sauce,' Jo Natale, Wegmans' vice president of media relations told Consumer Report. Natale also shed light on the fact that Wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded, which 'allows us to take a long-range view, invest in people, and grow at a controlled rate.' While only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely  satisfied with the quality of their store's produce, meat and poultry offerings; nationwide, Consumer Reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings. Findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including Wegmans, Publix, Costco, Whole Foods and Fresh Market were considered standouts in this category. So as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $5,400 on food, what makes a supermarket the best? The survey noted that those who were the 'freshest' stores were usually the best  overall. Wegmans (file photo above) was rated America's favorite supermarket followed by Publix, Trader Joe's and Fareway Stores .

We take more photos of ourselves than ever - but it seems selfies are doing little for our self-confidence. Women typically take and delete five pictures before settling on a selfie they feel comfortable posting online, a survey found. And men are happy only on their fourth try. The new survey found women typically take and delete five pictures before they decide they like a selfie . UKIP leader Nigel Farage poses with some young voters while out canvasing in Broadstairs. The survey, carried out by OnePoll, found men are also guilty of taking multiple selfies before they post one they like . Two in three women (64 per cent) feel anxious just having their photo taken, while looking at snaps on social media made 41 per cent feel bad about themselves, according to a survey of 5,000 people by market researchers OnePoll. Of the children who were also questioned, which included 58 per cent who took selfies, 79 per cent said they were happy with the way they looked, 67 per cent thought they needed to look good. ITV's Good Morning Britain show, which commissioned the research, is encouraging viewers to share the first selfie they take on social media under the hashtag #SelfieEsteem. Jamelia, Nicky Byrne, Beth Tweddle, Richard Madeley, Piers Morgan, Nancy Dell’Olio, Rebecca Ferguson are among the celebrities backing the campaign. Piers Morgan appears on Good Morning Britain along with presenter Susanna Reid. The ITV show commissioned the survey and is encouraging viewers to share the first selfie they take on social media .

It also found 15 per cent of women and 19 per cent of men had cropped, filtered, or retouched pictures of their children.

A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, "Wow!"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.

(CNN)Thinking about presidential candidates?  Apparently, hormones are a major factor one should consider. According to one female businesswoman in Texas, Hillary Clinton shouldn't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she'll start an unnecessary war. When George W. Bush waged an unnecessary war in Iraq -- was his testosterone to blame? As Cheryl Rios, the CEO of Go Ape Marketing, sees it: "We're built differently, we have different hormones. In the world that we live in, I understand that there's equal rights and that's a wonderful thing and I support all of that. I don't support a woman being president." "With the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war," Rios wrote in a Facebook post. If Rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the Oval Office, she'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president. Throughout history, male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders' decision-making. Studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts. If science doesn't convince you, just Google "cheating politicians" for the long and sordid list of men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Sanford and John Edwards, whose hormones got the best of them. Rios has taken a lot of flak for her "biblically" inspired beliefs, but she's not the only one who's arguing that a woman's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern. Time magazine declared Hillary Clinton the "perfect" age to be president, because she's a postmenopausal woman who is "biologically primed" to lead. (She also happens to be a former first lady, senator and secretary of state.) I'm not joking. Believe me, I wish I were. No wonder Jon Stewart left "The Daily Show" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing. If discussions about a candidate's hormones are what we have to look forward to, the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed. But underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration: The bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015, a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias. We want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything. And you'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college, graduate school and the work force. But what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability, but a bias in how women and girls are viewed. Unfortunately, Cheryl Rios' view of women is not unique. Some people believe women have "our place" and that place is not at the table. They'll tell your daughter to "go for it" but believe she isn't qualified to fulfill her dreams. In a compelling series about women and work, Wharton School professor Adam Grant and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes. The evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless. It's overt: There are more men on corporate boards named John, Robert, William or James than there are women on boards altogether. The bias is also covert: When students rate their favorite professors, they describe the men as "geniuses" and the women as "nice." The bias is real, yet so many of us are blind to it. Hillary Clinton might not be the perfect candidate, but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the White House a much steeper climb. That's not just a problem for Democrats -- it's a problem for Republicans, Independents, everyone. The fact is, equality benefits everyone. It's better for the bottom line (companies with more women in leadership roles make more money).  It's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier, healthier, and more successful. It's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages.  And it's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results. Our nation, our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men. It's not enough to say to our daughters: "You can be anything you want to be." What we need to say is: "You can be anything you want to be, despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong." Rios said that if Clinton is elected, she is "moving to Canada" because "a female shouldn't be president."  Apparently Rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about Canada: Kim Campbell became the country's first female prime minister in 1993. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Canadians elected their first female prime minister, Kim Campbell.

Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after an evening in which their relegation into Sky Bet League One was marked by pre-match supporters' protests against Karl Oyston. Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation . Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen. 'We got off to a flyer and having got back to 1-1 I'm a little bit disappointed we didn't take anything on a horrible night on a horrible pitch.'

Real Madrid have 48 hours to make a decision on Javier Hernandez as the clock runs down on their first option to buy the Manchester United striker. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Monday that the European champions would take stock of Hernandez's situation at the end of the season. However, under the terms set out by United when they loaned the 26-year-old to Madrid, Thursday April 30 marks the end of the Spanish club's 'exclusivity period' to buy the player. Javier Hernandez is enjoying a fine run of form at Real Madrid - scoring three times in his last two games . Hernandez (centre) returned to training with his Real Madrid team-mates on Tuesday . Hernandez (second left) was all smiles in training, but the 26-year-old faces an uncertain future . From Friday they will no longer have first option and United will field offers of around £10million from West Ham, Southampton and Lazio. The Mexico striker who has scored three goals in his last two games has one year left on contract at Old Trafford, but his latest displays have boosted his valuation. Ancelotti said: 'It is a subject that we will evaluate at the end of the season. What I can say is that I have liked his professionalism during the whole year. He is enjoying his opportunity a lot, he has a high level of professionalism and for a coach to have these type of players that are always ready is very positive.'

(CNN)People magazine has anointed Sandra Bullock the world's most beautiful woman of 2015, the publication revealed on Wednesday. Bullock, 50, joins a long line of actresses to receive the honor, including last year's cover girl, Lupita Nyong'o, and Gwyneth Paltrow in 2013. She seems to be taking it all in stride, calling the whole thing "ridiculous." "Real beauty is quiet. Especially in this town, it's just so hard not to say, 'Oh, I need to look like that,' " she told People. "No, be a good person; be a good mom; do a good job with the lunch; let someone cut in front of you who looks like they're in a bigger hurry. The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying." The cover story focuses on Bullock's home life with her son, Louis, 5, and her efforts to stay healthy and fit past her 40s. "I was putting him to bed and told him that even when I'm old and gray and more wrinkly than I am now, I'll still love him and want to tuck him in," she said. "And he asked why I have wrinkles, and I said, 'Well, I hope some of them are from laughing so much.' And he touched my face and said, 'You're not old, you're just happy.' " The Oscar-winning star of movies including "Gravity," "The Blind Side" and "Crash" said she's happy with who she is. "As long as I'm healthy and strong and I don't let this mind of mine run amok with insecurities about what I am not, I can look in the mirror and like who I see." The selection of Bullock, the oldest woman to receive top honors in the history of the list, is a sign that beauty knows no age, say some. "Great choice! Gorgeous, talented, over 50 and FABULOUS! That's the way it's done!" wrote one fan on People's Facebook page. Also making the "most beautiful" cut this year: Gabrielle Union, Ariana Grande and Laverne Cox. The issue hits newsstands Friday.

'This is not selfie time,' Wesley said jokingly. 'Let the brother worship in the house of God.' Churchgoers traditionally walk around to shake hands and give hugs during the greetings and announcements portion of service, but the pastor encouraged the crowd to stay in their seats and greet only their closest neighbors, as the sanctuary was tightly secured with Secret Service agents. The choir - including women in purple dresses and men sporting purple ties - sang a lively rendition of the hymn 'He Lives,' stirring most of the church, filled to capacity, to clap, sing and sway in praise alongside the upbeat organ keys while ushers collected the tithes and offering. Singalong: The family (pictured in the second row of the congregation) joined in with upbeat hymns . People queued around the block for the service in Alexandria, monitored by federal security officers . The lively pastor based his sermon around a scripture from 1 Corinthians 15 on the life and resurrection of Christ. 'Where do you stand in the resurrection of Christ,' he asked. 'You either believe it or reject it.' Wesley said the sacrifices of Christ allowed the congregation to be forgiven for their own sins. 'He took the pain for me. I owe him my life. I owe him my praise. I owe him my hallelujah,' he said. Appearing on Jimmy Fallon's talk show this week, the first lady revealed that she and her husband will be performing a routine with So You Think You Can Dance contestants on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll.

Jane Tipper had been walking her dog Molly when the eight-year-old chased a lamb over a cliff . A Border Terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall after chasing a spring lamb off the edge of  a cliff before spending three days stranded on a remote beach. Dog Molly had been on a walk with owner Jane Tipper and her daughter Hannah in Eype, Dorset, last week when the she fell over the cliff's edge along with the lamb. Molly survived a vertical drop of 100ft then rolled 150ft down a steep slope and coming to rest in gorse near the bottom. Her distraught owners managed to see that the eight-year-old had survived the drop, but had no way of getting down to the beach to get her. A team of ten coastguards arrived on the scene and a winchman was lowered down the cliff face but was unable to find her despite four hours of searching. Ms Tipper, who had been celebrating her 64th birthday, was forced to return home in nearby Charmouth without her beloved dog which she has had since she was a puppy. She contacted the website DogLost which arranged for missing posters to be put up in the area. Three days later, Molly was found in an exhaustive state after walking a mile further along the beach to an area popular with dog walkers. It is unclear what had happened, but luckily, she has come through her ordeal relatively unscathed - but there has been no sign of the lamb since the incident. Ms Tipper said: 'I was with my daughter, it was my birthday and we planned a short walk and lunch in a local cafe but we never got there. The border terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall, including a 100ft vertical drop, in Eype, Dorset, but her owner had no way of reaching her. Coastguards searched thoroughly but were unable to find her . 'Molly's usually very good, she doesn't chase animals. 'She fell about 200ft but the cliff was on a slight slope. I couldn't see her at the bottom but my daughter did so we knew she survived the drop. 'The coastguard winched one of them over the cliff and he went from side to side looking for her but couldn't see her. 'It's rocky there, there's thick patches of gorse and it's extremely dangerous. 'After a couple of hours they said they just couldn't spot her. They were very upset about it.' She added the incident left her 'completely numb'. 'We didn't stop searching at the end of the day,' she said. 'When I got home I phoned as many people as I could think of.' But fortunately, a female dog walker recognised Molly from the lost posters that had been put up in the area on Friday. After Ms Tipper put up missing dog posters, Molly was identified by a dog walker three days after going missing. Pictured right, the cliff face in Dorset where Molly fell . Ms Tipper added: 'The lady was walking her dogs when Molly followed her and sat next to her. She called me and we met up and fortunately it was Molly, I was worried it was going to be someone else's dog. 'Molly was very pleased to see me, especially when I got a gravy bone out of my pocket. 'She wasn't hurt or limping or anything, but she was shattered and spent the rest of the day asleep when we got home. 'I think it's really knocked the stuffing out of her. ' A coastguard spokesman urged dog owners to always keep their pets on lead while walking near the coast.

(CNN)Sawyer Sweeten grew up before the eyes of millions as a child star on the endearing family sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond." Early Thursday he committed suicide, his sister Madylin Sweeten said in a statement. He was 19. "This morning a terrible family tragedy has occurred," Madylin Sweeten said in a statement passed on by her manager Dino May. "We are devastated to report that our beloved brother, son, and friend, Sawyer Sweeten, took his own life. He was weeks away from his 20th birthday.  At this sensitive time, our family requests privacy and we beg of you to reach out to the ones you love."

Sawyer Sweeten was born in May 1995 in Brownwood, Texas. He was a year and a half old when he started on "Raymond," playing next to his real-life twin brother Sullivan, who starred as Michael Barone, according to the website IMDb. Their sister, Madylin, played their TV sister Ally Barone. The show was about the adults, and the children, especially the twins, had bit parts, adorable cameo moments. In the beginning, they were too young to speak. The series developed a loyal following and ran from September 1996 through May 2005. According to his IMDb profile, Sawyer did not appear to take on acting roles after "Raymond" was discontinued. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.

A video showing a man cracking a giant egg to reveal another fully formed egg inside, may be enough to scramble your brain. YouTube user Elman511 cracked open the over-sized egg that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ While the instance is extremely rare, it’s caused when the hen is in the process of forming an egg in her oviduct and another oocyte – the ovum or egg cell that becomes the yolk of the egg – is released too soon. Scroll down for video . Egg-traordinary: US YouTube user Elman511 cracked open an over-sized egg (shown on the left) that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ In the video, Elman511 cracks the egg, which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. He then cracks the smaller egg, which also has a yolk and white inside. ‘That’s the end of the nesting dolls of egg…an egg inside of an egg… crazy man,’ he said, before noting that the yolks look rich. Egg-citing: In the video, ‘Elman511’ cracks the egg (pictured), which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. The unusual occurrence is down to a counter-peristalsis contraction . This is when a second oocyte (yolk) is released by the hen's ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The unusual occurrence is called a counter-peristalsis contraction. A hen releases an oocyte from her left ovary into her oviduct every 18 to 26 hours, Back Yard Poultry Mag explained. Usually, the oocyte travels down the oviduct, adding layers of the egg until it’s laid through the hen’s vent. But in a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The phenomenon has been mentioned as far back as 1250 AD by the Dominican friar and polymath Albertus Magnus in his book De Animalibus. Ask the egg-spert: In a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. This results in an egg with another made inside it, producing two yolks (pictured)

(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for "lost" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the "holiday" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the "mistake" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the "war on women" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious "war on women" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The "war on women" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the "war on women" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative "solution" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.

Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge . A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman . 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'

An investigation has concluded Freddie Gray broke his neck after falling head-first into the back of the police van as it was moving, it was reported today. Medical and law enforcement sources briefed on the police investigation told ABC News Gray's 'catastrophic' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt 'in the back door of the van'. They claimed there was 'no evidence' Gray sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest, which was caught on camera on a street side on April 12. According to ABC's sources, Gray was standing in the van, bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door. It is believed he fell into the door, breaking his neck. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A report claims Freddie Gray broke his neck when he fell head-first into the back of the van as it was moving . Similar van: Freddie Gray was stood, bent over, with his head facing the back door of a van like this . Timeline? It is believed Gray fell head-first into the back of the van, breaking his neck, during the journey . Inside: The above diagram shows the inside the police van . Pictured: The second stop which police failed to report in their paperwork after the van journey, during which Freddie Gray sustained a 'catastrophic' head injury. It was picked up by a privately-owned security camera . According to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray . The news comes hours after Baltimore Police admitted the van transporting Gray made a previously unreported stop. The mysterious detail was picked up by a privately-owned security camera, and will be integral to the police investigation into Gray's death, which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on Thursday morning. It is not known why the van stopped at the corner of North Fremont Ave and Mosher Street before it made another two stops then finally transported Gray to the hospital. And police have yet to clarify why Gray would have been standing without a seat belt on. Just nine days before his arrest, the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy, making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van. Revelation: Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop. He refused to elaborate on the details of the new information . Police Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to elaborate on the new information. He said the contents of the report, which was completed and handed to the State Attorney at 8.50am Thursday, will remain confidential as they continue to investigate. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested. The report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver, who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators, according to ABC. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton. As the police department, Mayor's office, and state prosecutors refuse to address the development, it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of Gray's arrest more than two weeks ago. A relative of one of the suspended police officers told CNN she believes Gray was injured during his arrest outside the van. Her family member, she said, was based inside the van, and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he 'didn't do'. However, this theory is at odds with the medical examiner's report which allegedly found Gray sustained injuries by falling over inside the van, where he had been placed without a seat belt. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN her family member was in the van with Gray as he screamed and cried for medical help. But she believes the spinal injury which led to Gray's death was inflicted earlier, during his arrest on April 12. In an appeal that echoes Gray's family, she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow. 'Six officers did not injure this man,' she told Don Lemon. Secret stop: This is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stop . These are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stop . Jung Hwang's convenience store's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting Freddie Gray . 'Six officers didn't put him in the hospital. 'I'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did, that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.' Her words came after a police document was leaked to the Washington Post, in which the other prisoner in the transport van with Gray said he could hear the 25-year-old slamming himself against the wall. The prisoner speculated that Gray was trying to hurt himself. In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'. However, he admits he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton . The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family. 'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we've seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' Outrage over the unexplained death of a black man in Baltimore, Maryland prompted nationwide protests against police brutality on Wednesday from Houston to Boston. Baltimore has been the scene of near-nightly protests ever since the April 19 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who is believed to have been fatally injured while in police custody. State Attorney Marilyn Mosby urged the public to be patient as she reviews the information. 'While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,' Mosby said on Thursday. 'We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.' Freddie Gray: The 25-year-old was poisoned by lead paint as a child growing up in Baltimore . Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west side . Nicknamed 'Pepper', he was described by an ex-girlfriend as happy-go-lucky with an infectious sense of humor. The Baltimore police knew him, however, as a 5ft-8ins felon who had notched up at least 18 arrests and a handful of convictions - mainly for Class A drugs but also burglary, assault and illegal gambling. He was said to have set off running at the sight of police patrolling a well known open-air drug market. He was taken into custody for possession of a switchblade and during transport to the station he experienced what officers described as 'a medical emergency'. Gray, who had asthma, requested an inhaler and had trouble breathing in the van, but police didn't provide his inhaler. According to Gray's family his spine was severed 80 per cent at his neck, three vertebrae were fractured and his larynx was injured. Court papers describe Gray's childhood as problematic. He lived with his heroin-addicted disabled mother in a home in Sandtown-Winchester that contained enough poisonous lead in the peeling painted walls and windowsills for a court settlement to conclude that he and his two sisters were incapable of leading normal functioning lives. Lab tests conducted in the 1990s showed that they had levels of lead in their blood nearly double what the state of Maryland defines as the minimum for lead poisoning. In Baltimore, more than 2,600 children have been found to have high levels of lead in their blood, according an annual report released by the Maryland Department of the Environment in 2014. 'This is the toxic legacy of lead-based paint,” Ruth Ann Norton, head of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative and a founding member of the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission, told the Baltimore Sun. 'Our kids are ill equipped to stay in the classroom, finish school. They’re very unlikely to go on to higher education. They’re less likely to be able to hold a job', she said. 'They’re less equipped to be able to overcome the poverty and other circumstances that pull them down. Children with lead poisoning will have defects, regardless of whether their parents are ‘nice’ or not.' Gray lived off the resulting 'lead check' settlement although it is unclear exactly how much he received. Whatever money he did have he was said to spend buying designer accessories. The Sandtown neighborhood is a 72-block neighborhood made up of almost entirely of African Americans. More than one-third of residents live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter are unemployed. The majority of Maryland's state prison population are said to said to hail from Sandtown, according to the Justice Policy Institute.

Delisle was arrested on Monday following the release of the viral video. Children can be heard screaming and crying in the background of the chilling footage. 'In the heat of the moment, I kept filming.... As a mother, I got very angry. I said, "Before threatening my children, come and see me,"' Cyr told CBC Montreal. The man eventually went back to his car, says Cyr, after noticing that he was being filmed and that Cyr was calling police.

Cyr says that in the future if she sees a driver being reckless, she will not follow him, especially if she is with her children. 'Everyone will react differently, but I would like to say that if you see dangerous driving, do not follow the driver — the mistake that we made with two children in the back seat. We regret it tremendously. If it happens to you, pull over and just call police.' Delisle is scheduled to return to court July 7. He was released for the time being and ordered to stay away from the couple’s home and workplace and told not to communicate with them. Conditional release: Delisle released for the time being and ordered to stay away from the couple’s home and workplace and not communicate with them until he returns to court on July 7 .

Screeching around the track in a car he last drove more than 50 years ago, Sir Stirling Moss appears to have lost none of his racing pedigree. And at 85, the man widely seen as history's greatest all-round racer has revealed the unusual daily routine he thanks for his impressive longevity – 77 press-ups and half a bottle of Chardonnay. Sir Stirling, who won 212 races in his 14-year career, also spoke about how he has swapped the high-octane vehicles of his heyday for a tiny electric car that has a top speed of just 50mph. Reunited: Sir Stirling Moss sitting behind the wheel of the refurbished Austin-Healey Sprite . Success: The 85-year-old won 212 races during his 14-year career before a crash at Goodwood in 1962 . Back in action: Sir Stirling examines the refurbished car alongside Car SOS presenter Fuzz Townshend . Speaking to The Daily Mail, Sir Stirling said he sees fitness as a 'way of life' which is why he is still so confident behind the wheel. However, never one for strenuous gym sessions, he puts his health down to more unusual methods. He said: 'I have half a bottle of wine a day, which fits in very nicely, and that's it. I do what I call lady press ups and I do 77 a day. 'It's not as difficult as it sounds because I do them from a kneeling position. I could not do 70 press ups like I could when I was 30 years old. 'I've broken various bones during my career so I'm not that flexible. I think staying fit is a way of life more than anything else really.' When it comes to diet, he said he believes in indulgence and never denies himself something he wants. He said: 'I never go to bed hungry, let's put it that way, especially as Susie is such a fantastic cook. Car SOS sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. Above, Sir Stirling with presenters Fuzz Townshend and Tim Shaw . Sir Stirling drove the refurbished car in 1962 - one month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career (pictured above). He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks . 'I allow myself whatever I want but I would have to say my indulgences are that Susie and I drink one bottle of wine each day, white certainly, Chardonnay. And chocolate. I'm trying to cut that down but not that successfully.' He made the revelations after a new documentary reunited the father-of-two with the Austin-Healey Sprite he used as a training car before the 1962 Sebring three-hour race. The race took place a month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career. He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks. He returned to the cockpit a year later but decided against competing professionally as he felt he was no longer driving instinctively. The Austin-Healey Sprite was also used by the rest of his team, including Hollywood star Steve McQueen and racing legends Innes Ireland and Pedro Rodriguez. Car SOS, which broadcasts on the National Geographic Channel on Thursday, sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. While he found fame hurtling around corners at death-defying speeds, Sir Stirling now takes a more measured approach to the road. For the last 18 months he has been driving a Renault Twizy, an electric car with a top speed of 50mph. He said of the car, which retails for less than £7,000: 'I live right in the middle of London, right by Hyde Park Corner, and the limitations on an electric car like that, you don't notice them. 'If I lived outside the North Circular there might be times when I'd think "Crickey, I wonder if I'll make it back on the charge" but having said that, the Twizy is just the sort of car to have around London. Sir Stirling has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. Above, the couple at Silverstone in July 2011 . 'It is absolutely very different to the cars I used to drive. There are certainly good reasons to have a petrol car but living where I do, in the centre of London, I can't think of anything better than what I have got.' Sir Stirling, who was knighted in 2000, said he would not want to be a professional driver today because he thinks there are too few races. He said: 'It's quite different now though, they only do 18 races a year, I was doing 52 because I would go down to Australasia in the winter or Malaysia or South Africa and do all types of racing. ' It's so different now that you can't compare the life of a driver then and now. It's unfortunately one of those things that has moved on and I don't think will ever be able to move back.' He has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. He added: 'If your wife is your best friend that's the important thing to me. If every decision you think about or make or take you discuss with her first, I think that's very important. 'But then Susie says I do what I want anyway.' Car S.O.S. broadcasts on Thursday April 9 at 8pm on National Geographic Channel.

The police officer accused of murdering Walter Scott will be banned from seeing his first-born child for several months, it was revealed today. Patrol officer Michael Slager will be refused the right to hold the baby which his wife Jamie is set to give birth to in a few weeks. He is only granted video access to his eight and a half month's pregnant wife and an officer stands outside the booth whenever he talks to his family. They are not allowed to spend any time together and contact is via video screens with headphones at the Charleston County jail. But the baby will not be able to enter the South Carolina prison. Before the fall: Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, with his wife Jamie before his arrest. Slager was charged with murder after shooting Walter Scott, 50, after stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina . Visit: Michael Slager received a visit at Charleston County Jail last Friday from his pregnant wife and mom . It is deemed unsafe for an infant to enter the prison so Slager will have to rely on photographs as cell phones and access to the internet is forbidden. He will be informed by a telephone call and have to wait to see photographs, which will be examined by officials before being presented to him. When Jamie attended the jail on Friday, she was made to turn through the prison's reception area and take a seat next to a video screen for a talk with him which lasted around two hours. The booths are protected by screens to prevent onlookers from seeing inmates, but appointments have to made in advance. Relatives of other prisoners queued to use the video booths after registering with prison officials behind thick glass security screens as Jamie and her accused husband talked with the aid of headphones. But their first child together will not be allowed to visit him in prison until jail chiefs decide that the baby's health would not be at risk from being there. Although there is no specific age limit, prison policy is not to allow babies in. No date has yet been set for his first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away. Major Eric Watson of the Charleston County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online: 'He is treated just like any other prisoner, except for being in protective custody. 'His baby won't be coming to the prison and he will not be allowed to see the child. It could be several months before he does. 'His attorney can apply for the baby to be brought to the jail if he wants.' Walter Scott was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen. Family tell says the light was an accessory and both mandatory stop lamps were functioning . Slager, 33, already has two step children from his wife's previous marriage, but the new baby will be the first for him and Jamie. Major Watson said Slager had no access to the internet and was under close scrutiny to deter any threat from angry prisoners over the shooting of Walter,who was gunned down by the officer after being stopped for an apparent faulty tail light on his Mercedes. Walter's supporters and family say he was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen and this was wrong because the light was an accessory and both his obligatory stop lamps were functioning. Major Watson said Slager was being offered three meals a day and recreation time, but was isolated from other inmates. Housed in a room with one small window, he has no interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail. One released prisoner said outside the gates: 'Man, it ain't no holiday being in there. He has to watch his back more than most because of what he did. There's a lot of angry men in there, black and white.' Walter's brother Anthony said police faced 'many questions' about traffic stops based on racial profiling and that his brother's death should serve as a catalyst for a change in police policies. Meanwhile, the man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton. No date has yet been set for Slager's first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away . The mystery man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton . The 30-year-old was detained by police as Walter fled his Mercedes Benz before dying in a hail of bullets and later released. Pierre's family said they had no idea why he was in the car and how he came to be friends with the shooting victim. His grand mother Eunice Fulton, 70, said: 'I spoke with my daughter Franetta on Thursday and Pierre had only just told her he was in the car. 'It was a terrible incident but we haven't had the chance to speak to him about it. He used to live with me until a couple of years ago. But I don't where he hangs out now. He moves around.' Pierre, who was known to police, had stayed in the background since Walter was shot by officer Michael Slager and at the weekend rejected media requests for interviews. He has given a full statement to investigators, but police refused to reveal his name and what he has told them. He had requested privacy. Pierre was caught on the policeman's dash cam after Walter had fled and been shot. But police released him without charge and he was not suspected of any crime. He has convictions for unlawfully carrying a pistol and served 174 days in prison in 2005 and has been arrested several times. His grandmother added: 'He is a good grandson. He cares for his family. But I don't know what he is doing now.' Pierre has worked as a cleaner, laundry man and warehouseman over the years, but some members of his family have lost touch with him. Rosanne Grant of Alternative Staffing employment agency told Daily Mail Online: ' He worked at various jobs over the period of a year through me. The last time I hear about him was in 2006 and nothing since. I don't know what he has been working at.'

The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was ‘no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident’. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had ‘existed for some time prior to the accident’. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell’s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.’

Sunderland are trailing former Wigan striker Franco di Santo. The Argentine is playing for Werder Bremen and has scored 13 goals in 22 games this season. The Bundesliga side want £8million for the 26-year-old who Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton knows well from his time at Chelsea. Sunderland are considering a summer move for in-form Werder Bremen forward Franco Di Santo . The Argentine has been in superb form for his club this season, netting 13 goals in 22 games . Di Santo began his senior career with Chilean side Audax Italiano in 2006, before catching the Blues' eye two years later. However, he failed to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and following a similarly ineffectual loan spell at Blackburn Rovers, was sold to Wigan in 2010. He spent three seasons with the Lancashire-based outfit, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances. Di Santo was an unused substitute during the club's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2013, before being released at the end of that season. He made the move to the Bundesliga in August 2013 and has appeared to fulfil some of his early promise. Di Santo previously played for Chelsea but struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and was sold . Di Santo played for Wigan for three seasons, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances before being released .

(CNN)Roseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: "My vision is closing in now," she said. "I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up." Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making . Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) "It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of," explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. "Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision," Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy . Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk . Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . Eat your greens . Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries . Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke . While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.

Eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements, a study has claimed. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.

Jessica Silva has spoken about why she had to kill her abusive husband and revealed she hopes his family can one day forgive her for what she did. In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' On Sunday night, Jessica Silva speaks publicly for the first time about the day, Mother’s Day 2012, when she stabbed and killed her partner, the father of her young son. Last month she walked free from court, despite being convicted of manslaughter, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all. Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica’s parents). He revealed to Michael Usher that the ordeal had so destroyed Jessica that 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I didn't recognise her' Jessica Silva admits she was living in fear and violence and she told no one. 'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' 'During the interview she gets to the point where she reveals "my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness". 'I don't know if there will ever be a neat ending. 'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, "you're fat, you're ugly", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . 'On that fateful night, Jessica made a split-second decision to save herself and her family,' according to the 60 Minutes program. 'Jessica opens up about her life with Polkinghorne and recounts what happened the night that ended in his death.' 'I didn't realise that she was going to be as raw as she still was,' Usher added. 'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how "I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.' See the full story on 60 Minutes at 8.30pm on Nine tonight .

(CNN)A 32-year-old Massachusetts man is facing murder charges, authorities said Wednesday, four days after another man's remains were found in a duffel bag. The Middlesex District Attorney's Office said that Carlos Colina, 32, will be arraigned the morning of April 14 for murder in connection with the remains discovered Saturday in Cambridge. Earlier this week, Colina was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. A Middlesex County judge then revoked bail for Colina in another case he's involved in, for alleged assault and battery. The victim in that case is different from the one whose remains were found in recent days. Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. "This was a gruesome discovery," District Attorney Marian Ryan said. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.

Fired: Major General James Post III was fired on Friday after making a treason comment . An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane. A-10 retirement: The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the A-10,  low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support . The inspector general's investigation interviewed several witnesses who remembered Post using the word 'treason' to describe efforts to oppose the Air Force leadership's decision to retire the plane, either via a social media campaign or by talking to Congress. In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.' General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander. Post issued an apology on Friday and said he did not intend to try to prevent people from talking to lawmakers. Handed in a latter: General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander .

Ukip candidate Kim Rose (pictured handing out sausage rolls today) is being investigated by police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls . A Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event, which also saw veteran snooker player White play pool with local youngsters. Mr Rose, a jeweller, said he was oblivious until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. Laughing off the allegations, he said: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes. 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties. 'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 'He said, "it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.' Mr Rose, who will now have to report to a police station on Monday, added: 'It was a fantastic day. We laid on teas, coffees, sandwiches and some sausage rolls. 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.' Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right) branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll' Today Mr Rose was seen out in Southampton handing out sausage rolls to members of the public . He said: 'The Ukip support is very strong here and I feel the main political parties will do anything they can to scrutinise everything about us.' Mr Rose added that if other politicians fear voters could be 'bribed with sausage rolls', perhaps it is not surprising they will not trust the country with a referendum on EU membership. Today the parliamentary candidate was out campaigning on the streets of Southampton, handing out sausage rolls to members of the public. Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, backing Mr Rose. He said: 'I think it’s utter nonsense. There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions. 'Having a few sausage rolls I don’t really think counts as one of those.' Mr Rose said the event, which was attended by 250 people, took place at a community centre in Southampton on February 21 - more than a month before Parliament was officially dissolved. He invited veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, who he described as a long-time friend. The former world number two and six-time World Champion, nicknamed 'The Whirlwind', played pool with residents, who were charged £2 to attend the event. 'I've known Jimmy as a friend for a number of years and so I asked him to come down and play pool with the kids,' Mr Rose said. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. 'I didn't want to make the event very Ukip so we put all the party banners away and everybody had a game of pool with Jimmy.' The Electoral Commission said the pastry provision was a police matter. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We have a received an allegation of "treating" by a prospective parliamentary candidate, contrary to the Representation of the People Act 1983. We are looking into the complaint. No arrests have been made.' Electoral Commission rules on treating state: 'A person is guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting. 'Treating requires a corrupt intent - it does not apply to ordinary hospitality.' Anyone found guilty of treating can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. Mr Rose has been a member of Ukip since 1999. He briefly stood as an independent in the key marginal Southampton Itchen seat in 2010 before pulling out. He is campaigning on tackling deprivation in Southampton, as well as wanting to pull the UK out of the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron came under criticism in the constituency earlier this week after sending a letter to residents spelling the constituency's name wrong three times. His letter, which has his letterhead and signature, had 'Itchen' spelled as 'Itchin', prompting the Conservatives to apologise for the embarrassing mistake. The constituency's MP has been Labour's John Denham since 1992. He held the seat in 2010 by just 192 votes and is standing down after May 7.

He claimed he never blackmailed celebrities he snapped, merely offering them first option to buy the photos at the rate he would have sold them to publications. But police tapping his phone during an investigation heard him tell his then wife Nina: 'Yes, it's true, I ruin lives, I am a piece of s*** and I don't even feel guilty any more.'

A husband was left so traumatised by his wife's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock, despite his wife already being given a hefty payout. In a case which could have huge financial consequences for the NHS, Julie Ronayne was awarded £160,000 after she was left 'looking like Michelin man' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008. Her husband Edward, who lives with Mrs Ronayne in Netherley, Liverpool, was awarded £9,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife's appearance. Edward Ronayne was given £9,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up 'like Michelin man' after botched surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital (pictured) The severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis, which the woman had contracted during the surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation. The test case, being heard at London's Appeal Court, could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an NHS mishap. Mr Ronayne was awarded the damages from Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust in July 2013. Liverpool County Court heard how he had been a 'secondary victim' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife's new appearance. He had described her 'colloquially as looking like a Michelin man', the court heard. Mr Ronayne also described his wife's first two days in hospital as 'the worst days of my entire life'. He said he had been 'brought up not to complain' but had never fully recovered from the sight. He added that he had been left feeling tearful, overwhelmed, angry and powerless. The judge, who described him as 'an honest and reliable witness', said: 'His symptoms...were pathological and went beyond simply the distress and anger that a man would suffer due to the near terminal illness of his wife.' But in the appeal court today, Charles Cory-Wright QC, who represents the health trust, told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury. He said Mr Ronayne's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims, costing the cash-strapped NHS millions in compensation. The barrister argued that Mr Ronayne would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation. He added that he was visiting his wife in hospital and therefore would have expected her to look unwell. He told the court: 'Hospitals on a day-to-day basis deal with people who are ill or vulnerable. They go there followed by their loved ones. It is unfortunately a matter of day-to-day occurrence that great emotional responses will take place in a hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if Mr Ronayne is allowed to keep the money. The test case is being heard at the appeal court . 'The question arises more and more often in cases like this as to whether those relatives have a claim.' Stressing the importance of the appeal, he told the judges: 'This appeal is not just about this case, but the concerns NHS Trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place. Peritonitis is caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the stomach. It is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, which can rapidly spread around the body. Peritonitis requires immediate treatment and is a medical emergency. Most cases of peritonitis are the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix or digestive disorders. Peritonitis can be fatal and needs to be treated quickly to avoid such complications. Source: NHS . 'The effect of this judgement, if it stands, is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases, as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock. 'Often emotional illness follows, but there is not the necessary element of shock. There needs to be a suddenly shocking event which, because of its shocking nature, causes that psychiatric illness. That is often lost in the wash in these cases.' But Lord Justice Sullivan said the incident had no doubt been 'shocking' 'Simply going into hospital and seeing one's loved ones and family looking peaky is not enough,' he said. 'But to see one's wife looking like the Michelin man is shocking.' Mr Cory-Wright then replied: 'If you saw your loved one looking like the Michelin man, swollen and all that, it would be shocking in an ordinary sense. 'But it would not be shocking in the sense of being suddenly overwhelmed so as to lead to psychiatric injury.' The judges recognised the importance of the case by reserving their decision on the trust's appeal until a later date. The case was heard in front of Lord Justice Sullivan, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Beatson. Mrs Ronayne went on to make a good recovery.

John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United with thousands of supporters planning to boycott Sunday's home match against Spurs. The 50-year-old has found himself the target of angry fans who are disillusioned with Mike Ashley’s running of the club. Results on the pitch – they have lost five on the spin - have not helped Carver’s cause, but the problems at Newcastle run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad. John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United . United’s supporters will protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from billionaire Ashley, especially as the Magpies have returned record profits of £18.7million and this week revealed they also have £34m sat in a bank account. Carver is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer – or deflect – questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis, distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul. But as reported by Sportsmail last month, senior sources within St James’ Park have indicated that Derby boss Steve McClaren will take over in the summer, regardless of whether or not the Rams are promoted from the Championship. On Tyneside, however, he will inherit what Carver believes is the toughest task in the land: ‘I think it is the hardest job in football, definitely,’ he said. Steve McClaren has already been tipped as a replacement for Carver should he face the Newcastle axe . ‘For me, this is the dream job, but you love it and hate it at the same time. ‘The hardest thing is taking the criticism off your own people. Some of it is deserved and some of it is not. ‘Sometimes you’re dealt the hand and you’ve got to get on with it and this is the hand I’ve been dealt. ‘When I took it on, if I hadn’t accepted then I would have been kicking myself. ‘And I’ve said this before, I genuinely believe that if I’ve got the right tools I can do the job. ‘But it is bitter sweet at the moment. This job is definitely a rollercoaster.’ Website AshleyOut.com are co-ordinating Sunday's planned boycott. They will protest outside of the Gallowgate End before kick-off and after the game. During the match they will go to Leazes Park behind the stadium. Carver, though, has urged fans to get behind the team. Fans are unhappy at how Newcastle are being run under Mike Ashley and have planned a boycott . ‘I would go to the match because I support the team,’ said Carver when asked if he would stay away as a supporter. ‘I think they (boycotters) do support the team but they have obviously got their own issues. I respect those issues. ‘I never thought I'd see this to be perfectly honest, especially in the North East of England because we love football. ‘So obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come, and I respect that.’ Carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against Tottenham Hotspur .

This is the moment when a not-so-little baby elephant seal emerged from the sea to give a surprised tourist one big cuddle. Charlene Fritz, 35, was visiting  Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula as part of an expedition when she made an unusual friend on the beach. Despite being no more than two months old, the elephant seal pup is still thought to have weighed around 200lbs, and Ms Fritz had a struggle sitting upright. Scroll down for video . One big cuddle: The elephant seal is thought to have been no more than two months old, but at a whopping 200lbs, Canadian tourist Charlene Fritz still struggled to reciprocate the hug . Making friends: Ms Fritz had the surprise of a lifetime when the baby elephant seal came out of the water for a cuddle during an expedition to Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula . Will you be my mummy? Elephant seal pups are abandoned by their mothers at just one month to learn how to take care of themselves . Charlene, from Saskatchewan, Canada, said: 'The seal climbed on top of me without hesitation. We shared a very sweet moment in time I will never forget. 'Her mouth was all pink inside and her eyes were amazing to look into. Like the deepest depths of the sea. I could have stared into her eyes forever.' She added: 'It was made very clear to me that I was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her. 'She came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up. I wanted to hug her so badly. 'Physically she felt like a big dough ball, super warm and like she had no bones. She did not smell of fish or have bad breath. She had never even eaten a fish at that point in her life. Rules: Ms Fritz explains that she badly wanted to hug the baby seal, but that regulations on the Antarctic expedition dictated that she in no way touch the pup . 'Sweet moment in time': Ms Fritz described the seal pup's eyes as being 'like the deepest depths of the sea' Crushing: Ms Fritz struggles to sit upright under the weight of the 200lbs baby elephant seal . Two young elephant selas have a rest on the shore of Snow Hill Island, Antarctic Peninsula . Charlene, whose 2011 encounter with the seal was filmed by a friend, had at first wondered why the seal was so friendly but later learned about the harsh weaning process. She said: 'Basically the mother fattens them up with her milk for a month or so, then abandons them on the beach. 'They have never been in the ocean to learn to fish or anything and basically lay there starving until they figure out to take the leap of faith and go into the sea. 'This is why they can be so sweet and looking for love, I guess.' However, an encounter with a full-grown elephant would have been a different prospect. Males of the species can weigh up to two tonnes and are known to have a nasty temper during mating season as the battle to control harems of females.

(CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are "conscientious objectors," and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new "no jab, no pay" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. "The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments," said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. "It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing," Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.

Many people might think that trust issues, long distances and cheating scandals are the biggest strains on a relationship. But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.

James Bond would have lasted just seven minutes into his last movie Skyfall before succumbing to fatal wounds from a uranium shot if the secret agent played by Daniel Craig was real. A group of medical experts watched the 23rd outing for Ian Fleming's hero and concluded that Bond would have been unlikely to survive to the end of the two hour film, and would have died or been critically injured several times . Within the first seven minutes, Bond is hit by a depleted uranium shell - an armour-piercing round normally used to destroy tanks that would almost certainly have killed the hero. Scroll down for video . James Bond would have died minutes into Skyfall - after being hit by a depleted uranium shell and then falling from a speeding train, where he could easily have severed his spine . As Bond fights in an icy loch he would have been likely to have died from the cold or lack of oxygen . In a feature for Total Film, the medical experts examine several different action movies to see whether the man characters would have survived their ordeal. Other movies to undergo the medical assessment were Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis. Unsurprisingly John McClane would not have survived. According to the experts, Bond's depleted uranium wound would have been fatal as it 'would have turned his lungs inside out and killed him'. In the unlikely event the massive round did not cause catastrophic injuries, the radioactive nature of the ammunition 'would greatly increase his cancer risk'. Bond cheats death throughout the two hour film, including when he is locked in a gunfight on the streets of Istanbul as he attempts to chase villain Patrice for a hard drive containing details of undercover agents . The hero effortlessly performs surgery on himself, but would have been likely to have lost too much blood . Not that growing old gracefully was ever likely for James Bond, who at one stage performs surgery on himself to remove a bullet, where he 'risks blood loss, lack of consciousness, nerve and muscle damage'. He also faces a significant risk of infection. Even jumping from the roof of a speeding train into a river presents its own risks, which probably should not be tried by ordinary members of the public as he would likely 'sever his spinal cord or break his neck'. 7 mins - Bond is shot in the chest by a depleted uranium bullet, likely to kill. If he had survived this the radioactive qualities of the ammunition would have increased his risk of cancer. 12 mins - The action hero is shot and then jumps from the roof of a speeding train into a river. The height of this fall would be likely to break his neck. 31 mins - After being shot Bond bravely removes a bullet from his shoulder. This DIY surgery would have led to significant blood loss as well as damaged his nerves and muscles. 2hrs - Bond fights in an icy loch. While the temperature alone would have presented problems, fighting underwater would have significantly depleted Bond's oxygen supply and could have caused him to drown. While James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 has survived since 1960, it is unlikely the man himself would have . However, filming the movie can prove slightly dangerous as Daniel Craig has recently required knee surgery after hurting himself while performing a stunt in his final Bond movie Spectre. Even Home Alone would have produced three fatalities. Marv and Harry would have likely died within hours of the movie's end while Kevin would have been killed within the first third of the film after falling from some shelves. However, Tom Hanks in Cast Away could have plausibly survived on a desert island for four years - as long as he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash. Although according to the experts, 76 per cent of the time he would have died in the accident. While Bruce WIllis' character in Die Hard, John McClane, pictured, would not have made it to the fourth movie . Tom Hanks in Castaway could have survived on the island - in the unlikely event he escaped the aircraft .

Need to have a difficult conversation with your other half or your boss? It might be a good idea to take them out to dinner. We get on better with each other over a meal, according to researchers who said it makes everyone from work colleagues to children seem more pleasant. Dutch and Canadian scientists asked nearly 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent at least five minutes talking to someone else. Well digested: Scientists have found people felt happier and more relaxed while eating at home or at work . About a fifth of the 1,000 meetings recorded took place over a meal, the journal Physiology and Behavior reports. On these occasions participants felt happier and more relaxed, whether at home, at work or elsewhere. They felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments and were more likely to make compromises. They also believed that the person they were with was warmer and more likeable. And hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. One possible explanation is that chewing raises levels of the ‘feel-good’ brain chemical serotonin. Food for thought: The study found that people can talk about tricky subjects far easier over a meal . It is also possible that shared meals enhance our inbuilt desire to be accepted and to please others. Marije aan het Rot, of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, said that tricky topics might be best tackled over a meal. Bosses and employees and also parents and children, might all find it easier to get on at the table while dinner may not be the best idea for a first date. Dr Rot said the people in her study knew each other and the effect of a sharing a meal might be different among strangers. Apart from anything else, meals can be lengthy and people meeting for the first time might struggle to come up with enough conversation.

Have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door, been woken by a Facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger? To deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies, one company has designed a range of prototype products. You can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product, funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Scroll down for video . Leeds-based Direct Line is running a competition called #EverydayFix. They asked groups to design products to deal with common problems. These include forgetting to lock the door, which one company hopes to solve with their Forget Me Lock prototype, shown . The products were designed as part of the Direct Line Everyday Fix design makeathon. They asked people to pick their top ten ‘everyday emergencies’ - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives. Groups from London-based design company Makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist. 1. Not being able to sleep (46 per cent*) 2. Losing your keys (37 per cent) 3. Being stuck in traffic when already late (35 per cent) 4. Losing an important paper or document (33 per cent) 5. Nowhere to park (32 per cent) 6. Printer not working when you need to print something (31 per cent) 7. Running out of battery on your phone whilst out (31 per cent) 8. Discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo (30 per cent) 9. Dealing with machine operated customer service (26 per cent) 10. Forgetting your bank card when paying for an item (25 per cent) *How many people thought this was a problem . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called ‘Snooze’, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep. To deal with not remembering if you had locked your door, ONN Studio created the Forget Me Lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door. It fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. This means that even when out or about, you can find out if your door is locked or not. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost. Direct Line is running a competition on Twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about Snooze, Forget Me Lock or Nipper. The Forget Me Lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key. When the key is turned in a lock it swivels green  to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost . The Nipper device (shown) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called Snooze, shown, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep . Whichever tweet has the most retweets, with the #EverydayFix hashtag, by 23 April will go into a Kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development. ‘We’ve seen the great British designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies,’ said Paul Smyth, co-founder of Makerversity. ‘Through the Direct Line Everyday Fix event, we’ve been able to extend our role as "fixers" and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation’s everyday emergencies,’ added John Shaw, head of R&D and Innovation at Direct Line. Of the products that didn’t make the cut, one was a helmet with ‘bone conduction headphones’ that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you. Another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space, which would then alert you when the space was free, if you couldn’t find somewhere to park. And as another solution to your phone running out of battery, one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies. Products that didn't make the final shortlist included the Parking Pin, shown. You could leave this in a parking space, and it will alert you when the space is free, so you can park your car . The Relay app, shown, would let you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies . And the 'Hat Nav' was a smart helmet that used ‘bone conduction headphones’ to give you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .

A cancer survivor who had to have part of his mouth removed after a tumour stopped him from swallowing has been given a new tongue made out of part of his arm. David Billing, 48, has told how he had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital, during which surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue. Medics then replaced the lost tissue with muscle from Mr Billing's arm. The only drawback is that it still has hairs on it, and he now has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved. David Billing, 48, had to have part of his tongue removed after being diagnosed with mouth cancer, so doctors made him a new one out of skin from his arm - which still has hairs on it . The dramatic story began after Mr Billing, a part-time welder, went to his GP in October 2013 after being unable to swallow. After a second doctor's appointment, he was referred to Royal Derby where specialists discovered an ulcer on the right-hand side of his tongue and confirmed it was cancer after a biopsy. He said: 'Being told I had cancer was mind-blowing and a real low point for me. I had no idea when they found this ulcer in my mouth that this was what it would be.' It was a double-blow for Mr Billing, as he had been made redundant just a week before from his job at digger manufacturer JCB. He said: 'It was all so overwhelming. My life and everything was ticking along nicely and the next thing I knew I'd lost my job and needed to have a major operation.' David had the procedure to remove the lump and rebuild his tongue on November 13, 2013. He said: 'I had to have a stomach tube fitted first and then go through the main procedure. Mr Billing was forced to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital (pictured), with surgeons sawing between two teeth and through his jaw to get to the tumour . 'They had to cut through the jawbone and get my face wide open to get to the ulcer then they had to remove some lymph nodes in my neck too, just to be safe in case the cancer had spread.' David spent nine days in hospital after his operation, returning now only for check-ups and once for the smaller procedure to reshape his tongue. He said: 'Usually, people have to go on chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the operation and, during this, the skin tissue used to rebuild the tongue shrinks in size. 'Because I didn't need either, it meant I later needed this smaller operation to have the bit of skin trimmed. 'My tongue's absolutely fine. I had to have speech therapy after the procedure but it's not had any long term impact on my speech or my eating or drinking.' David continued to use a feeding tube and relied on liquid foods until his first proper meal on Christmas Day 2013. And, in another fortunate turn of events, he was offered his old job a JCB back in March 2014. He added: 'JCB actually took me back having originally laid me off because of a lack of work. Mr Billing, who is now preparing to run the London Marathon to raise money for Cancer Research, says his speech is back to normal - though he does have to go to hospital to have his tongue shaved . 'It was the best feeling in the world when, two weeks after coming through the operation, the consultant told me the cancer was completely removed and I didn't even need radiotherapy or chemotherapy.' Now David is preparing to run the London Marathon and is hoping to raise more than £3,000 for cancer research. He said: 'I was not fit or well at all when I was watching the London Marathon last year but I thought how much I'd love to do it. 'I've never done anything like it before so, when I started feeling better, I decided to start training and now I'm about to take part in this experience of a lifetime. 'If I can get over the finish line, whatever time I do it in, it will be absolutely brilliant.'

The lovers who got the most complaints in New York City for loud sex are a handyman and the girlfriend he pops round for quickies with in the building where he works. The 25-year-old boytoy is the lover, of a Dominican woman in her late 30s, who invites him round for romps around her entire apartment in Brooklyn. The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex. Most complained: The building maintenance worker (left) and his girlfriend (right), who is now four months pregnant, were complained about six times for excessive noise at the Bay Ridge block, official records show . Say it loud: This is the apartment block with six calls made to 311 - New York city's non-emergency number - because of complaints of loud sex . Blue: The woman who was complained about was spoken to by police today. She later left, saying: 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone.' The woman whose moans during sex sparked the highest number of complaints in New York said today: 'I'm not hurting anyone'. The woman, who declined to give her name, walked out of the apartment block wearing striped maxi dres, a white jacket and sunglasses. She looked upset and said she was hurt by all the attention - and revealed she was pregnant. She said: 'I'm four months pregnant. 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'. On the job: The building handyman complained about over noisy sex was at work today - at the apartment block where his girlfriend lives. House of noise: The apartment building is in Bay Ridge, close to New York harbor in Brooklyn . No idea: The building's owner Madelene Behefte told Daily Mail Online she had no idea about the complaints . No respite: The front door of the apartment at the center of six complaints for noisy sex. It failed to stop neighbors from overhearing the couple's antics . DNAInfo reported that New York's 311 helpline, for non-emergency complaints to city authorities, recorded a total of 133 complaints about loud sex between January 1 2014 and February 12 2015. Brooklyn, the borough now associated with trendy hipsters and home to would-be president Hillary Clinton's campaign, had the highest number of complaints, at 42. Brooklyn is the most populous of the city's five boroughs. Queens was next with 37, the Bronx and 31 and Manhattan had 23. Staten Island recorded none. The website reported that on November 14 last year, a 311 operator logged: 'Neighbors are having very loud sex with the windows open that can be heard throughout the whole bldg.' The complainant told the website the woman was 'moaning and screaming "Oh yeah, oh, do it to me".' It was followed by another woman shouting at the couple: 'Shut your f***ing windows you wh**e.' Complaints to 311 are passed to police to investigate if they are available, but officers found no noise disturbance when they attended the Bay Ridge block.

Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless. The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, José Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than £300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for. Pacquiao works up a sweat as he shadow boxes during preparations for his May 2 clash with Mayweather . With his eyes closed and grimacing with effort, Pacquiao ramps up his shadow boxing routine on Monday . On his toes and focused, Pacquiao is looking to defy the odds against fight favourite Floyd Mayweather . Roach kneels in the corner as Pacquiao's team prepare the eight-division champion for a session on the pads . The Filipino works his way around the ring, looking sharp after sharing a joke with Shapiro and Roach . Pacman limbers up ahead of his workout on Monday in the gym just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood . Pacquiao is going through his final preparations ahead of the bout billed as 'The Biggest Fight in History' Confident Pacquiao kicks his feet high during his warm-up ahead of training at Wild Card Boxing . There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight. Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout. 'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'

Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to quit because he was becoming increasing depressed watching cable news . Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to call time on his 17 year reign because he was becoming increasing depressed by American politics and watching cable news. Speaking for the first time since making his shock decision, Stewart said he was looking forward to not having to watch the 'relentless' 24-hour news networks anymore. 'Watching these channels all day is incredibly depressing,' Stewart told The Guardian. 'I live in a constant state of depression. I think of us as turd miners. I put on my helmet, I go and mine turds, hopefully I don't get turd lung disease.' Asked if he'd ever voluntarily watch Fox News, Stewart said, 'Let's say that it's a nuclear winter, and I have been wandering, and there appears to be a flickering light through what appears to be a radioactive cloud and I think that light might be a food source that could help my family. 'I might glance at it for a moment until I realize, that's Fox News, and then I shut it off.' Stewart also confessed that his 'moments of dissatisfaction' with the show had started to become more frequent. 'It's not like I thought [The Daily Show] wasn't working any more, or that I didn't know how to do it. It was more, "Yup, it's working. But I'm not getting the same satisfaction,'" he said. 'These things are cyclical. You have moments of dissatisfaction, and then you come out of it and it's OK. But the cycles become longer and maybe more entrenched, and that's when you realize, "OK, I'm on the back side of it now.'" Scroll down for video . Stewart said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance in 2011 . Even the upcoming 2016 Presidential election campaign couldn't reignite Stewart's passion the way it once did. 'I'd covered an election four times, and it didn't appear that there was going to be anything wildly different about this one,' said Stewart. 'Honestly, it was a combination of the limitations of my brain and a format that is geared towards following an increasingly redundant process, which is our political process. 'I was just thinking, "Are there other ways to skin this cat?' And, beyond that, it would be nice to be home when my little elves get home from school, occasionally." Stewart also said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance. The former secretary of defense appeared on The Daily Show in 2011 for an interview, which the comedian says he messed up. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, left, would be taking over . 'He just went into the general gobbledegook,' said Stewart. "Mnah mnah mnah, well, you have to remember, it was 9/11 mnah mnah." I should have pushed, but he's very adept at deflecting.' Rumsfeld, who was on the show to promote his memoir, Known And Unknown, dodged Stewart's questions about faulty U.S. intelligence leading up to the Iraq War. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, 31, would be taking over. Noah has already had to combat  accusations of anti-Semitism over a series of old tweets. Stewart has voiced his full support for his successor, recently calling the incoming host 'incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart.' The exiting host told The Guardian that one reason for  stepping down early in the presidential election cycle was to give Noah a big story to tackle. Stewart said he felt 'that, for the show, you don't want to leave when the cupboard's bare. So I think it's a better introduction when you have something providing you with assisted fuel, like a presidential campaign.'

An eight-grade girl accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in adult jail while awaiting trial, a judge. A defense petition to return 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek to the juvenile facility where she was initially sent after the body of 54-year-old Cheryl Silvonek was discovered last month was denied by Lehigh County Judge Maria Dantos on Friday. District Attorney Jim Martin had opposed the petition on behalf of the teenager, who is charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy. Her boyfriend, Caleb Barnes, 20, who is from El Paso, Texas, but was stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, is charged with homicide. JamieSilvonek, the eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, it was ruled on Friday . Cheryl Silvonek's body was found with stab wounds in a shallow grave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and her vehicle partially submerged in a pond a few miles from the family home. Jamie Silvonek was sent to the county jail this month after she was charged as an adult and is in the women's housing unit, away from older inmates, county officials said. Authorities said Barnes and the teenager met in October, when she was 13, but she told him she was 17. Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. The teen's mother found out about their relationship in early March and ordered them to end it. A day later, the teen told Barnes in a text message, 'I want her gone,' police said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. The 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. 14-year-old JamieSilvonek allegedly conspired to kill her mother Cheryl Silvonek with her 20-year-old boyfriend 'because she disapproved of their relationship' Barnes confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, and that given the age disparity 'there has to be some type of duress or coercion'. He said his client 'cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom' and she feared for her life and that of her father. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life . Police found the body of Cheryl Silvonek in a shallow grave a few miles from her home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby .

Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed for a year after orchestrating a scam to steal £15,000 of goods from the Asda in Basildon, Essex, where he worked . An Asda manager orchestrated a scam that used the supermarket's own delivery service to steal goods worth more than £15,000 - then managed to land a job at Lidl after he was sacked. Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed after running the scam where stock including alcohol, cigarettes, DVDs, computer games and consoles were taken from the store in Basildon, Essex, where he worked. Southend Crown Court heard how the conspiracy was uncovered, following a period during which Gridley and colleague Jay Reed were under suspicion. Thomas Daniel, prosecuting, told the court that goods, ranging from televisions to baby formula, were delivered to Reed's address and presumably sold on. He said: 'Two anonymous reports were received by Asda, one of which suggested Mr Gridley was involved in selling items believed to have been stolen, such as TVs and baby formula. 'When Mr Gridley was ill for a certain period of time, those deliveries stopped, and when he recovered they started again. 'Another email suggested stolen goods being delivered to the address of Mr Gridley's cousin.' But shockingly, after being sacked from the store, Gridley managed to land a managerial role at Lidl in Romford, Essex. Gridley, who was former home shopping manager of the store, was sentenced to 12 months for his leading role in a conspiracy to steal £15,852.46 worth of goods between November 2013 and April last year. The court heard that Reed and another defendant James Munyard had been pressured into taking part in the scam by Gridley, who was their superior. Stock including alcohol, cigarettes were taken from shelves and delivered to addresses using the supermarket's own home delivery service. File photo . Section leader Reed, 23, and Munyard, 21, both avoided prison, but were given suspended sentences of eight and four months, respectively. Mitchell Cohen, representing Munyard, told the court that his client, whose role was confined to taking items off shelves and putting them in a crate, had attempted to be transferred from the store in order to escape Gridley's control. James Munyard (pictured) avoided jail for his part in the scam . Reed was deemed to have been in a position of trust and responsibility in the criminal enterprise, but Recorder Gerard Pounder said he had a lesser role than Gridley, 26, and Munyard even less so. Despite hearing Gridley, of Tilbury,  financially supported his former partner and their two-year-old child but also his own father and grandparents, Recorder Pounder said he had no choice but to send him to prison. He said: 'You were in a position of supreme trust and you say you started this because of threats made regarding a drug debt of your cousin's, you continued even as those threats faded, and brought other people in, too.' Sentencing Reed to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 200 hours' unpaid work, he said: 'You were in a lesser role than Mr Gridley but you were a section leader and had responsibilities. 'In that respect you were somebody who knew the system and it was to your premises these items were taken - without that and your part in the enterprise, it would not have worked.' Munyard, who Mr Cohen said 'didn't have the spine to stand up to what he was being asked to do,' was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, and 100 hours' unpaid work. A spokesperson for Lidl told MailOnline they are unable to comment until an internal investigation has been conducted.

The 14-time major champion is bidding to win his fifth green jacket, but has been plagued by a succession of injuries and even the chipping yips in recent times. The world will find out which version of Woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48pm. Defending champion Bubba Watson, hoping to win his third Masters title in four years, will tee off at 2.24pm alongside England's former US Open champion Justin Rose and 21-year-old South Korean amateur Gunn Yang, who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the US Amateur last year. Those watching the 2.02pm group on Thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game's most colourful characters go head-to-head. Ian Poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet, but even he might meet his match in American young gun Patrick Reed, who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at Doral last year. He followed that up by shushing the home crowd during a cocksure display at Gleneagles. Three-time Masters champion Phil MIckelson, hitting from behind trees during practice, will play alongside McIlroy in the first two rounds . Ryan Moore, pictured during a practice round at Augusta, will join McIlroy and Mickelson on the course for round one and two . Woods will be accompanied with Wales' Jamie Donaldson and Jimmy Walker of the USA during the first two rounds of the competition . US Open champion Martin Kaymer is in the group behind world No 1 McIlroy, with Brandt Snedeker and Houston Open winner JB Holmes. McIlroy and Mickelson were among the players battling for the US PGA title in near-darkness at Valhalla last year, with Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light. With 98 players in the field, Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45pm (7:45am local time), with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier, the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while Arnold Palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder. England's Danny Willett will begin his Masters debut in the second group at 12:56pm alongside 1987 winner Larry Mize and US amateur public links champion Byron Meth. Woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth Masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round. The American superstar has started just two events in 2015, carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second, but said he was ready to 'compete to win a golf tournament' after 11 holes of practice on Monday. The final group tees off at 1:59pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world, Australia's Jason Day, Spain's Sergio Garcia and Fowler. Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors last year.

A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by £345 to £975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from £870 to £1,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices . The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from £870 to £1,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game . Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay £345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost £975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season . Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.

A pregnant mother with a rare form of dwarfism has revealed the physical challenges of raising her three-year-old son - who is more than half her size - while preparing for the arrival of her second child. Tiffanie DiDonato, from Swansboro, North Carolina, was born with diastrophic dysplasia and underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries as a child so she would grow to be 4'10 tall, instead of her previous height of 3'8, which is how tall her son Titan currently is. But even with the additional inches, parenting a rambunctious toddler can be difficult for the 34-year-old mom who has certain physical limitations, and often has to use crutches, or sometimes a wheelchair, in addition to being three months pregnant. 'Titan is a typical kid – he wants to do what he wants to do,' she told People of her son. 'And chasing him outside or across the street is not an option for me.' Helping hand: Tiffanie DiDonato, who has diastrophic dysplasia, a rare form of dwarfism, can be seen grocery shopping with her three-year-old son Titan, who is more than half her size, but always willing to assist her . Making it work: The 34-year-old mom from Swansboro, North Carolina, is 4'10 tall and is constantly re-teaching herself to walk because of the stiff muscles and arthritis, which are side effects of her dwarfism . Tiffanie, who married to Eric Gabrielse, a 6’1, 29-year-old Marine who is 6'0, explained that she has to get creative when it comes to dealing with her son - especially when he throws himself on the floor and cries. When tantrums occurs she will walk way and say: 'Mommy can't help when you're yelling at me... No crying and Mommy can help.' Tiffanie noted that this trick, which she has developed over time, usually prompts her son to get up and give her a hug. 'I try my best to let him know throwing tantrums doesn't get you very far - a great lesson to learn, don't you think?' she said. Great news: Tiffanie and her husband Eric Gabrielse, a 29-year-old Marine, are expecting their second child in September . All smiles: Titan happily cuddled up to his dad for this snapshot . Full of life: The three-year-old had a laugh while his dad Eric enjoyed his breakfast . Tiffanie, who co-wrote the memoir Dwarf with Rennie Dyball, has difficulty lifting Titan now that is getting taller because her arms are significantly shorter than most moms. The stiff muscles and arthritis that are side effects of her condition mean that she has to constantly re-teach herself how to walk - which makes chasing after Titan impossible. Losing control of her son is one of her greatest fears, which is why she avoids leaving the house with Titan when she doesn’t her husband Eric or another family member by her side. 'I have even watched Eric struggle to catch him outside and he's a Marine!' she explained. ‘We named Titan correctly, because he's almost too speedy and too athletic.' Because she 'wouldn't stand a chance' against outracing her son, she makes sure she stays '10 steps ahead of the game' at all times. Overcoming obstacles: Tiffanie can be seen as a child wearing braces on her legs. She underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries when she was younger . Painful choice: Tiffanie was expected to be 3'8 tall, but her surgeries allowed her to grow to 4'10, enabling her to be more independent . Tiffanie recalled times in which Titan has climbed into the dryer or wedged himself behind the couch or plopped himself inside the sink. Without physically being able to get him out on her own, she has to rely on her own quick thinking, as well as game she made up to ensure his cooperation. She explained that when she sings: 'One, two, three, help me!' and reaches out for Titan, he will take her hands and pull himself up and out of whatever precarious situation he has gotten himself into. Titan's willingness to lend his mom a helping hand is one of the reasons she is confident that he will be a fantastic big brother. 'He really is - whether he is intentionally doing so or no - becoming my little helper,' she said. 'We conquer the day-to-day challenges together, and I hope we always do.' Sweet moment: Tiffanie and Titan snuggled up together on the couch before he fell asleep . Support system: Tiffanie wore a yellow halter dress while posing for this photo with a friend . Sports fans: Eric and Tiffanie smiled for the camera at a Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium in New York City .

An Old Bailey judge has blasted his junior colleague for ‘taking his eye off the ball’ and passing an 'unlawful' sentence when letting a BT manager dodge jail for a £28,000 expenses scam. Wheelchair-bound  Christopher Starrs, 50, was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in January after admitting his part in a two-and-a-half year con against his employer BT. Starrs, along with fellow BT Openreach manager Phillip Tamplin, invented clamped cars, overtime hours and damage to home owners’ property during broadband installation, and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims. Blasted: Judge Nicholas Cooke QC (left) blasted his junior colleague Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC (right) for 'taking his eye off the ball' when he sentenced Christopher Starrs in January this year . Both Starrs and Tamplin, 53, who made £124,000 from the con, admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses. Tamplin was jailed for two years at January's sentencing hearing, but Mr Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC spared Starrs jail as an ‘act of mercy’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £1,500 fine. However, senior Judge Nicholas Cooke QC has now said the sentence was ‘unlawful’ - and added Starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes. ‘It was an unlawful sentence passed and now I need to do something to put it right, because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter,’ he said. ‘He was mercifully dealt with, sadly by a judge who didn’t have his eye on the ball.’ The judge told Mark Haslam, defending: ‘The sentence was wrong but that’s a matter of personal opinion. ‘Your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison. ‘What the Recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn’t available to him. ‘No one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on Mr Starrs was unlawful. ‘I am sorry to be the headmaster but we really don’t want this sort of thing.’ Fraud: Wheelchair-bound Starrs, 50, was a manager with BT who admitted defrauding the company of £28,000 over two years . The Recorder, who is the head of 4 Bream Buildings chambers and took the Silk in 2006, gave Starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine, and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue. But Judge Cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order. Turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing, he added: ‘This is supposed to be a centre of excellence, when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and can’t do. ‘The judge should have been told what his powers were.’ Prosecutor John Ojakovoh said Starrs offered a ‘blank cheque’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £28,000 he stole. After the judge heard the CPS will now drop the confiscation proceedings, he said the original sentence will stand, quipping: ‘He no doubt thanks his lucky stars.’ Both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time. The main fraudulent claim was for BT vehicles which had been ‘clamped’ by parking authorities. BT Openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work. The company pays out around £1million in fines in London alone every year. Starrs and Tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates. Sentencing Recorder Trimmer, who has led a string of high-profile Serious Fraud Office prosecutions in the last two years, said: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time. ‘It involved over 100 or so false claims, made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity. ‘Both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity. ‘You both knew how it could be conducted, concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally.’ Starrs, of Northolt, Middlesex, who had worked at BT since 1988, was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair. He was not at court today due to a mix-up over whether he was required to attend.

A forensic psychiatrist has testified that Lou Gehrig's disease is the reason a former sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his wife and sister-in-law, whom the defendant described in a suicide note as his threesome partners. Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.

The US body that regulates Internet addresses is looking to crack down on a Canadian company using the new '.sucks' domain name to extract exorbitant sums from celebrities such as Kevin Spacey and companies looking to protect their reputations. So far, purchased names include Youtube.sucks, Bing.sucks, Visa.sucks, Bankofamerica.sucks, Yahoo.sucks, Telusmobility.sucks and other major brand names. Kevin Spacey has reportedly paid have his his '.sucks' domain taken down. Kevin Spacey is reportedly among celebrities paying out to have their name removed from one of the  '.sucks' domains which opened on 30 March . Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains attacking her, CNBC reported. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or 'ICANN,'  sent a letter on Thursday to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Office of Consumer Affairs to see if the actions of company Vox Populi Registry Ltd. were illegal. ICANN initially approved of the so-called top-level domain name, among nearly 600 it has added recently to expand beyond common names such as '.com,' '.org' and '.us.' But it is backtracking after an advisory panel made up of industry groups and companies like Microsoft, Verizon and eBay complained last month. Vox Populi began accepting registrations using '.sucks' on March 30 from trademark holders and celebrities before it is released to public applicants. Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains . It has recommended charging $2,499 a year for the privilege, and according to Vox Populi CEO John Berard, most of the names have been sold by resellers for around $2,000 a year. Berard has said the domain name is meant to create destinations for companies to interact with their critics and called his company's business 'well within the lines of ICANN rules and the law.' Two weeks ago, the advisory body called the Intellectual Property Constituency representing major companies and industry groups asked ICANN in a letter to halt the rollout of '.sucks,' calling it a 'shakedown scheme' and 'predatory.' Companies like GoDaddy.com register some domain names for just $1 a year, and Vox Populi will offer consumers the right to secure a '.sucks' address for just $10 a year starting in September. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme.' ICANN said in its letter that if Canadian or U.S. regulators find Vox Populi's actions are illegal, it could declare the company in breach of its contract and seek to change the registry's behavior. It said it is also seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme .

The semi-final line-up for the Champions League has been confirmed and, although there may be no English involvement, four European giants are just three games from being crowned champions of the continent in Berlin on June 6. With Real Madrid and Juventus winning on Wednesday to join Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the last four, this season's competition is one of the toughest to call in recent memory. We asked our team of reporters who they think will win this season's Champions League. SAMI MOKBEL - Barcelona . Momentum is key at this point in the season and Barcelona are in overdrive. Their early-season woes are a distant memory and Luis Enrique is finally getting his point across. Lionel Messi remains phenomenal and a certain Luis Suarez is hitting top gear just at the right time. Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left) , Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) NEIL ASHTON - Bayern Munich . They overcame their blip (the rip in the seam of Pep's trousers) to power their way beyond Porto in the second leg of the quarter-final and remind everyone just how good they are. They have much to prove after last season's disappointment but they are a phenomenal team. I expect them to draw Barcelona in the semi-final. Bayern Munich produced a stunning display in the second leg to beat Porto in the quarter-finals . JOE BERNSTEIN - Barcelona . Bayern and Barcelona are both better teams than Juventus or Real Madrid and to separate them is nigh on impossible. But given the backroom strife at Bayern, particularly over Arjen Robben's injury, I'd narrowly go for Messi and Barcelona ending their four-year Champions League 'drought'. DOMINIC KING - Barcelona . To think at the start of the season, after Real Madrid pummelled them in the first Clasico, that we thought the beginning of the end had started. Now they look majestic once more and the front three of Messi, Neymar and Suarez gives them an edge over all their rivals. Hopefully it will be a straight shootout between them and Bayern Munich in Berlin. This is the best Champions League semi-final line-up ever and we might get the spectacular final to go with it. LEE CLAYTON - Juventus . Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba and Gianluigi Buffon -  experience, goals and know-how. Tevez isn't Messi (or Cristiano Ronaldo), Pogba isn't Thomas Muller and Buffon isn't Manuel Neuer: Yes, they are ugly bugs on a catwalk of super powers, but they CAN win this. After all, Denmark and Greece both won the Euros. Juventus celebrate their 1-0 aggregate victory over Monaco in the last eight of the Champions League . Juventus striker Carlos Tevez leads the scoring in Serie A this season with 18 goals . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI - Barcelona . Since it's been established that we don't live in a post-Messi (48 goals in 49 starts) world I can't bring myself to bet against him. Would love to see them in a final against Bayern Munich. CHRIS WHEELER - Bayern Munich . After that crushing 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the semi-finals a year ago, and the shock of suffering a 3-1 first-leg loss to Porto in this season’s quarters, expect the real Bayern to stand up and deliver another Champions League triumph for Guardiola. Is it written in the stars that Barcelona will be standing in his way? LAURIE WHITWELL - Barcelona . The front three of Messi, Suarez, and Neymar are beginning to click to devastating effect and the magical allure of Barcelona is returning. It would be some turnaround from the disputes and disappointments of early season, but this is a team full of players who know how to win the trophy. Neymar scored both goals in Barcelona's 2-0 second-leg victory over Paris Saint-Germain at the Nou Camp . LAURA WILLIAMSON - Real Madrid . They might be depleted by injuries but experience and pedigree count in this competition and, as we saw against Atletico Madrid, you can never count against the 10-time winners. Or, indeed, a certain Ronaldo. Javier Hernandez's 88th-minute winner saw Real Madrid edge past their local rivals Atletico Madrid . Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League title and a second in a row with Real Madrid . ROB DRAPER - Bayern Munich . Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben are on the way back, Pep  has a point to prove and the team have the memory of that awful semi-final against Real Madrid last year to drive them on. As long as they don't take their foot off the gas having already won the Bundesliga, they'll make good the disappointment of last year. Robert Lewandowski celebrates one of five first-half goals Bayern Munich scored against Porto on Tuesday . JACK GAUGHAN - Barcelona . I'm tempted to say Bayern Munich but they've got similar buckling deficiencies to the Barcelona we've seen recently. By contrast, the Catalans have found their misplaced defensive steel, have a coach whose win percentage eclipses all to precede him and - well - possess Messi. And Neymar. And Suarez. SAM CUNNINGHAM - Bayern Munich . I would back Guardiola to outwit any of the remaining managers in the tournament with the players at his disposal. Some were writing Bayern Munich off after their 3-1 first-leg defeat by Porto and look how that went. Everyone talks about Messi and Ronaldo, but the collective force of Bayern players is frightening. OLIVER TODD - Barcelona . After a difficult start to the season they've hit form at the right time. Enrique has found a way to get the front three of Messi,  Suarez and Neymar to fire and even if you can keep two of them quiet - as Paris Saint-Germain did on Tuesday - the other will make you pay.

Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.

Steve Davis would love to see Jimmy White and Reanne Evans light up the Crucible stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn. The king of the baize in the 1980s believes the Whirlwind and the doyenne of the women's tour face tall orders to get through qualifying for the Betfred World Championship. Evans saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion Ken Doherty on Thursday, in the first of three preliminary rounds, while White will tackle fellow veteran James Wattana in his opener on Saturday. Steve Davis will attempt to qualify for this year's Betfred World Championship at the Crucible . But Davis, who will also attempt to qualify, expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in Sheffield. He calls 29-year-old Dudley potter Evans 'a great player', and said of the 10-time ladies' world champion: 'It's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods. It's a bun fight, but she's perhaps the best woman player I've ever seen. 'In the 1980s I saw Allison Fisher who was the best around, and she was an excellent, excellent player but more methodical. 'Reanne is more like the Jimmy White or the Ronnie O'Sullivan of the women's game. She has the feel for the game, she's at one with the table. 'She could cause a surprise, but to win three matches is the tough bit. It's hard enough for me and Jimmy. 'If me or Jimmy qualify for the Crucible, it's arguably as big a win as we've ever had. 'I've got a little bit of a desire to do it, but Jimmy would certainly love to get back to the Crucible.' Reanne Evans takes on Ken Docherty for a place at the World Championships in Sheffield . Reanne Evans is a 10-time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010-11 season. She suffered 18 consecutive defeats however and failed to qualify the following year. White, who lost six World Championship finals, last appeared at the tournament in 2006, and has fallen short in qualifying every year since. While 52-year-old White is in the autumn of his career, for Davis these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down. He turns 58 in August and fell off the main tour 12 months ago. A memoir, Interesting, hits the bookshelves on Thursday. A tricky qualifying opener against Jamie Cope could end in disappointment, but it would be short-lived. 'I can't build up the intensity that I used to have, but I must admit I'm getting excited about pitting my wits against another generation of players,' Davis said. 'Of course, it'll all end in tears. 'I'm not totally committed but I still have the juices running through me a little bit. I've been practising but it's not a pretty sight. They're wobbling more in the pockets before saying 'nope'. 'Whether I get to the TV stages, that's a long shot. That's tough. Jimmy White will take on fellow veteran James Wattana in qualifying on Thursday . 'I was still practising hard even when I wasn't getting to the latter stages of the Crucible, and in the end you have to say, 'Yeah, I've tried, but the price is too much investment of time'. 'Now if I've lost a match, by the time I've got in the car I've thought about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day, rather than beating up the person who's come up with me. 'I think it's been a bit like Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I'm sure in the night that someone swapped me for a more mellow version.' Davis won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament, but the 1985 'black-ball final' defeat to Dennis Taylor stands over and above all memories. Dennis Taylor in action during the memorable 1985 World Championship final against Davis . The second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant Davis having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again. 'I don't remember anything as much as I remember the '85 final,' Davis said. 'I do remember the last frame, more so because I've watched it through on video a few times. 'My career was a blur and all games and matches blur into one in the end, it's only the strange moments that do stick in your brain.'

(CNN)Is America a nation divided?  And has Ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions? It's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation: immigration, community and police relations, poverty, education and dozens of other crucial matters facing America. Adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite, and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country. In Ohio, we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services, criminal justice, economic competiveness, infrastructure -- and I've enjoyed sharing our state's winning formula with others in my travels. In 2011, I returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in Congress in the 1980s and '90s.  Over the intervening years, Ohio had lost its way and was hurting. I felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 Ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet. Ohio is much stronger today. And that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing. For example, we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation's strongest state budgets and a nearly $2 billion surplus. We've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones. We've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in America, including tax cuts for the working poor. We're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and Ohio's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade. Getting Ohio back on track wasn't easy. It required big ideas, going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests. Yes, we have a great success story to tell about our state. And we need to make Ohio's success contagious. The leadership style that helped us turn around Ohio is needed in Washington, where America's $18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting Mother's Day if it required their action. Great leaders are not primarily guided by polls, political parties, focus groups, re-election, special interests or protecting the status quo. Instead they bring teams of people together, challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee in Congress in the 1990s, I helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. We worked in a bipartisan effort that doesn't happen enough. There were, of course, disagreements along the way, but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means. Given the polarizing issues facing our country, America needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego, selfishness and power produce. Leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets, tax cuts, welfare reform, border security, immigration and health care. We see it every day. There are certain values that guide great countries: . • Personal responsibility: It obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities. • Empathy: It allows us to walk in someone else's shoes, so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another, better way that makes all of us stronger. • Teamwork: It sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win. • Faith: It tells us we are made special in the image of God with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth. These values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all Americans instead of producing rhetoric, sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform. In Ohio we've implemented this winning strategy. It's worked there, and it will work for the nation as well.

A tortoise has been reunited with his owner after spending nearly a year on the run and even finding a new home - at the age of 109. Owner Wendy Stokes, 74, had given up hope of ever seeing Toby again after he escaped from her garden 11 months ago. But he has now returned home and after piecing together his escapades over the last year, it's become apparent he's had quite an adventure. Reunited: Wendy Stokes, 74, is delighted to have 109-year-old Toby back after his escape 11 months ago . He wandered through a gate in her garden and headed for the open road where he was picked up by a passing driver concerned for his safety and taken to a nearby animal rescue centre. Six months ago, he was re-homed with a couple living in Margate, Kent, 22 miles away from Wendy's farm in West Hougham. But the couple, who could just about make out the word 'Stokes' written in white paint on his shell, felt they needed to find out who Tony belonged to. With nothing else to go on, they decided to call every Stokes in Kent listed in the phonebook. Eventually came across a delighted Wendy, who immediately arranged to collect him. She's had Toby since the 1980s when he was given to her by her late great aunt. He was returned home last Sunday, a full 11 months after his amazing, if a little slow, adventure. Wendy has had Toby since the 1980s and wrote her surname, Stokes, on his back in white paint . Retired farm worker Wendy said: 'I had painted my name and number on the side of his shell but it had faded when he went missing so they couldn't read it. 'The people who found him could read Stokes but they couldn't make out the number. 'He had got out because I had left my gate open. It is normally closed because we have sheep in the paddock but they were in a different field. 'Toby just walked out and trotted towards the road where somebody picked him up and took him to a rescue centre. 'Everyone knows I have a tortoise and we always take him to the village fete so he is a bit of a local celebrity. 'I was devastated when he went missing and spent weeks looking for him in all the fields around the farm.' She added: 'I went all goosey when they told me they had Toby because I had really given up on him. 'It is brilliant having him back and I think everybody was keeping their eye out for him all this time.'

A vicious swan known for terrorising punters and kayakers on the River Cam is now believed to have a grandson following in his footsteps. The savage swan nicknamed Asbaby, which still has many brown baby feathers, has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the Cambridge river. Mr Asbo, the swan believed to be his grandfather, was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 by river authorities after repeatedly attacking rowers. Scroll down for video . Watch out: Savage swan Asbaby has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the river in Cambridge over the Easter weekend . Up close: One resident who lives near the river said Asbaby 'sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers' Theft: Asbaby was seen attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag (above) Capturing the moment: Asbaby (pictured) is believed to be the grandson of Mr Asbo, who was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 . Pecking at the punters: The swan on the River Cam is said to be even more vicious than his father, Asboy, and grandfather, Asbo . Asbaby was seen at the weekend attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag. He is said to have inherited his bad temper from his grandfather, and his father Asboy, who conducted a reign of terror on the river last summer. Harry Crossell, 65, who lives near the river, said: ‘He is even more vicious than his father and grandfather. '(He) sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers. I’ve seen him chasing after punts and taking their picnics. 'Once I even saw him put his beak around a bottle of champagne. ‘It’s terrifying for river users and it’s making people think twice about going out on the water.’ Another resident, Simon Patterson, 52, said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour would get worse as he gets older. ‘The swan is only young at the moment, we’re concerned he will get stronger and more vicious as he grows bigger,’ he said. Shock: The swan got up close with this woman, whose surprise at what was unfolding in front of her could clearly be seen (right) Making an appearance: The juvenile swan nicknamed Asbaby got far too close for comfort to tourists on the Cam over the Easter weekend . Naughty swan: One resident said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour on the River Cam would get worse as he gets older . ‘He swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way. We thought Mr Asbo and Asboy were bad, but this swan is even worse. ‘It’s very worrying as the river is starting to get busier now, if he continues someone could get really hurt.’ But Colin Sparkes, navigation officer for Conservators of the River Cam, told MailOnline today: ‘Most swans get a bit aggressive this time of year. ‘It's mating season - they protect their territory. As far as I’m aware, it's not causing great problems on the river. ‘Swans this time of year start to look out for their nest, and indeed when the young and born. ‘It’s a very tricky one because the more people feed the swans, the more aggressive they tend to become. Close to the camera: Asbaby 'swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way', according to one local resident . Worrying: Asbaby's actions are said to be 'terrifying for river users' and are 'making people think twice about going out on the water' Threatening: The behaviour of Mr Asbo (above) before he was moved 60 miles three years ago left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises . No longer there: The Cam Conservators moved Mr Asbo about 60 miles away in 2012. His son Asboy is seen above in this file photograph . 'They get used to swimming up to people expecting to be fed.’ He confirmed that there are no plans to remove Asbaby from the river, adding that the case of Mr Asbo was completely different. Mr Sparkes said: ‘That swan (Mr Asbo) was extremely aggressive - it's the most aggressive swan I've ever come across. ‘I believe that was probably down to the way he'd been brought up looking for food from various people.’ The Conservators moved Mr Asbo away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself. His behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises - and a marshal was employed during a university rowing race to stop him injuring students. It has previously been reported how Asboy was seen attacking punters, birds and even a cow. He also injured a canoeist and a swimmer.

The Conservative know that they need to turn large parts of the country blue on May 7. And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate Alec Shelbrooke in Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.

Wednesday have brought in Adam Pearson and Glenn Roeder to work alongside head coach Stuart Gray. Sheffield Wednesday chief executive Paul Aldridge (left) will leave the club at the end of next season . Chairman Dejphon Chansiri said the trio would form 'a three-man sporting director by committee' at Hillsborough. Former Hull City and Derby County owner Pearson will advise on business. Aldridge said: 'I have had a tremendous time at the club and look forward to playing my part next season in what I hope will be a very successful campaign. Glenn Roeder is now part of a new managerial committee team at the Championship outfit . Adam Pearson helped lead Hull to the Premier League and will be hoping he can do the same at Wednesday . 'I am sure by giving the chairman sufficient time to consider who is the right person to lead the club into its 150th anniversary, he will appoint the most suitable successor. 'I know I have a very busy summer ahead, we have at least two major projects starting later this month. Supporters will notice a big difference when they come back at the start of next season and see the new pitch and giant screen. 'I am also hoping to be very busy playing my part in the overhaul of the playing squad, the chairman has made it quite clear he wants to be challenging from the start of the new season.' Stuart Gray is the manager of the club and has done well since taking over from former boss Dave Jones .

After months of speculation - and years of her friends' doubts - Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has admitted she never had cancer. With her business empire destroyed and her online community in tatters, Gibson today admitted her fatal cancer 'diagnoses' were lies. 'No. None of it is true,' she said, during a series of interviews published in the latest edition of the Australian Women's Weekly. In the interviews - which questioned her relationship with the truth and her understanding of cancer - Gibson said she was not seeking forgiveness. 'I don't want forgiveness. I just think (it) was the responsible thing to do. Above anything, I would like people to say, 'Okay, she's human'. Gibson's confession was the first time she has spoken publicly since - under fire from furious former fans - she told Daily Mail Australia she feared for her family's safety. Scroll down for video . Ms Gibson revealed the truth of her cancer diagnosis in an interview . Ms Gibson, pictured kissing her son Olivier, 4, on the head, said: 'None of it was true' Her business empire in tatters and her relationship with her fans broken, Ms Gibson is thought to be struggling financially. The Women's Weekly said she was not paid for her interview . Ms Gibson's interview will be published in this month's edition of the Australian Women's Weekly . The wellness blogger was a prominent Australian social media personality. Her Instagram fan base ballooned after she 'revealed' she had prolonger her life by embracing an alternative lifestyle. Her 'whole foods' business became famously successful. Penguin published her recipe book and her app was to be offered on the Apple Watch. But it all fell apart last month after revelations emerged Ms Gibson had failed to fulfil promised donations to various charities. Friends then began to cast doubts about her cancer diagnoses. She then tearfully 'admitted' she may have been 'misdiagnosed' by a 'Dr Phil'. The  Weekly insists it did not pay for the story and that it was approached by Ms Gibson's 'people', the Melbourne 'corporate advisory' firm Bespoke Approach. Ms Gibson said her partner, Clive Rothwell, was sticking by her in spite of the controversy. But she said he had taken a 'stern' line with her and insisted she play a straight bat. 'He’s been very stern, along the lines of, ‘I just want you to acknowledge where you’ve f***ed up and try not to smooth over that,' she was quoted saying. In the article, titled 'My Lifelong Struggle With The Truth', Ms Gibson also said she had been forced to raise herself from the day she started school. She said she took upon common household responsibilities, such as bringing her brother to school and making lunches. But she would not provide her mother's name or contact details to the magazine. In her previous interview, Ms Gibson said she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion'. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) was also a popular app. It will not appear on the Apple Watch any longer . But she took aim at many of her former fans who she believed had responded 'maliciously' - claiming that her son's childcare details, home address and floor plan were published online. Former friends had called upon Ms Gibson to 'come clean' with the truth about her situation and had long privately questioned the veracity of her story. Authorities told Daily Mail Australia  at the beginning of April that Ms Gibson is still facing an official investigation. A former friend of Ms Gibson directly called on her to 'come clean' in an interview with Daily Mail Australia in March. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want'

A ‘unique and beautiful’ teenage girl was killed by a driver who crashed a stolen car while drunk and high on cocaine and cannabis. Xana Doyle, 19, was a passenger in the Toyota Avensis, which flipped and landed on its roof in an accident in the early hours of the morning. Driver Sakhawat Ali, 23, was more than twice the drink-drive limit and had been taking class A and B drugs before getting behind the wheel. Xana Doyle (pictured) was killed after driver Sakhawat Ali crashed a stolen car while high on drugs . The Toyota Avensis flipped and landed on its roof after the crash in the early hours of the morning in January . A court heard he was driving at ‘excessive speed’ in the moments before the crash, which did not involve any other vehicle. Miss Doyle, who suffered a ‘blunt head injury’, was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales. Ali admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday. Judge Neil Bidder QC told the court: ‘The driver was well over twice the drink-drive limit and it is accepted there was excessive speed.’ The judge said he wanted more information on how much cocaine and cannabis the driver had taken on the night of the smash before sentencing. Ali, of Newport, was remanded in custody ahead of a hearing in July. Sakhawat Ali (pictured right) admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking . The driver’s cousin, Shabaz Ali, 21, admitted allowing himself to be carried in a stolen car following the smash in January this year. The July hearing will decide whether he ‘contributed’ to the accident by pulling the handbrake from the back seat. Floral tributes were left at the scene of the accident and hundreds of people attended the funeral of Miss Doyle, a former Duffryn High School student, in January. In a tribute, her mother Emma O’Donoghue wrote that Xana was an ‘unusual name for a unique and beautiful girl’. Before the crash, Miss Doyle, from Newport, had recently begun working at Wetherspoons as a cook and was also a trained beautician after completing an apprenticeship. Ms O’Donoghue said yesterday: ‘No sentence will ever give me back my daughter or my children their sister. She is dearly missed and this terribly traumatic experience will remain with us for ever. ‘I am pleased that Sakhawat Ali has pleaded guilty, not that he could dispute any of the evidence presented. Miss Doyle suffered a 'blunt head injury' and was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales . Ali was remanded in custody and a hearing in July will determine if his cousin also contributed to the crash . ‘Xana was a beautiful, funny and loving girl and every day is a struggle to live on without her in our lives, we can only hope that justice is served and those responsible are held accountable.’ Paying tribute to Miss Doyle at her funeral, her mother said: ‘You had a smile that would stop this world spinning around. ‘I always knew that you were kind and loving and even through your difficult teenage years you never forgot to tell me how much you loved me and appreciated my support. ‘In the last two years you blossomed into a beautiful young woman, independent and hard-working, making us all so proud of you.’ She added that she had fond memories of her daughter playing and fooling around with her sisters, Lauren and Eve, and her brother Zane. Miss Doyle, whose white coffin was adorned with red roses, gave ‘unquivering friendship and support’ to her friends and family throughout her life, her mother added.

A young woman has managed to find her doppelgänger after launching a campaign on Facebook as a social experiment - and their likeness is mind-blowing. Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old  TV presenter from Dublin, teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed Twin Strangers to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days, and were soon inundated with submissions from all over the world. Incredibly, Niamh found her match in Karen Branigan, 29, a fellow Ireland native who lives just an hour down the road, making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together. Scroll down for video . Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Speaking to MailOnline about her first meeting with Karen, Niamh said: I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the entire duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face, and some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, "Oh my God that’s my face." 'I can’t remember the number of times I said "this is so freaky". It was truly amazing.' Karen, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Niamh has a brother and two sisters, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Niamh said the pair got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities.

'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry says. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!'

They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' Niamh states. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?'

It may have been invented for students to use. But youngsters appear to be deserting Facebook in droves because it is now so popular with their parents – and grandparents. Almost a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’. The trend comes as increasing numbers of older users turn to the social network to stay in touch and share family pictures. Nearly 60 per cent of Britons aged over 55 now have a Facebook account, according to research. Facebook has even started running television adverts to entice the so-called ‘silver surfers’ to join. Now a survey of around 2,000 Britons has revealed that it is having the opposite effect on youngsters. ‘As parents are signing up, their children are logging off to maintain privacy,’ said Lord Jim Knight, chairman of online lobby group the Tinder Foundation. In the poll, a third of Facebook users are said to have blocked a family member so they can no longer see their account or do not receive automatic updates. The survey did not take account of the number of youngsters who have effectively blocked their family members by refusing to add them as a ‘Facebook friend’ in the first place. One in ten people aged 16 to 34 signed up to other platforms so they could remain ‘under the radar of their parents’. But whilst youngsters may be leaving Facebook, they are not giving up on social media altogether. More than half said they had joined Twitter, where only 13 per cent of ‘silver surfers’ said they have accounts. Meanwhile, about 40 per cent of youngsters use the picture-sharing website Instagram, according to the study commissioned by Halifax and carried out by Opinium Research. Logging off: Nearly a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their facebook accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’ Around the same proportion use Snapchat, a social media platform which automatically deletes messages shortly after they are sent. The picture was very different among the over-55s. Just three percent have an Instagram account and even fewer – around one percent – use Snapchat. The way people use these different social platforms is also changing. Around a fifth of those aged 16 to 34 use their smartphones at family dinners, posing a threat to the precious mealtimes that used to be the cornerstone on family life. By comparison, just one percent of silver surfers use their smartphones during a meal with their offspring.

Alan Pardew has warned Crystal Palace's Barclays Premier League admirers that if they want to sign Yannick Bolasie this summer then the bidding will have to start at £20million. It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.' Bolasie scores against Sunderland as he helped Crystal Palace beat the struggling Premier League side .

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini accepts his side are now facing a fight to stay in the Champions League places. City appear to have lost too much ground to Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race and their recent form has led to a further worry, with the sides behind them catching fast. The fading champions could even find themselves in fourth place before they next play - at Crystal Palace on Monday - if results go against them over the weekend. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) shakes hands with David Silva during Manchester City training . Martin Demichelis (left), Wilfried Bony (centre) and Fernando during Friday's session . Frank Lampard (right) looks to play a pass as he and his team-mates are put through their paces . This is not a battle they envisaged having to fight at the start of the campaign but Pellegrini realises nothing can be taken for granted after a frustrating second half of the season. Pellegrini said: 'I think in this league you can never be sure you are going to have a Champions League place. You have six or seven teams that, from the beginning, all of them play for that position. 'At the moment, for the whole year, we have been in a position of the Champions League. I hope that we will continue.' Pellegrini believes his side are now in a battle for the Champions League places and not the title . Manchester City have struggled to keep up with Chelsea, who are closing in on the Premier League trophy . The ramifications of dropping out of the top four, however, are not really something Pellegrini wants to consider, given that he still has hopes of landing the title. With just eight games remaining and a significant deficit to make up on Chelsea that looks a forlorn task, but Pellegrini is not giving up. The Chilean said: 'Of course if we want to continue in the first position of the table we must not drop any more points. It is easy to say but not easy to do it. 'We just know that from now until the end of the season we will try to win all the games and we will see if we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end.' Sergio Aguero has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks but will hope to find the net on Monday . James Milner is in line to return after withdrawing from the England squad with a knee problem . City will hope to be at full strength for the trip to Selhurst Park. Pellegrini reported nothing other than 'small problems' when asked about any injury concerns at his pre-match press conference. That means a likely return for key midfielder Yaya Toure, who missed the 3-0 victory over West Brom a fortnight ago with an Achilles problem but has since played for Ivory Coast. Fellow midfielder James Milner has also been troubled by a knee problem in recent weeks - and withdrew from England's midweek friendly in Italy - but the issue is not thought serious.

Radamel Falcao could still sign permanently for Manchester United after it emerged that chief executive Ed Woodward held talks with Monaco on Sunday over the striker’s future. Falcao, who has scored just four times for United since his season-long loan move from Monaco, drew another blank at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea on Saturday evening. But Woodward told Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev last Sunday that they would make a decision on the right to sign him permanently at the end of the season. Manchester United could sign Radamel Falcao permanently after holding talks with Monaco on Sunday . The striker has endured a frustrating season on loan at Man United and has managed just four league goals . Vasilyev said: ‘I saw the Manchester United people last Sunday and they have not yet decided if they would exercise the option.. ‘It’s not his best season, but they kept the opportunity to make a decision at the end of the season.’ Although it seems highly unlikely that United will keep the Colombian striker, Falcao has been given hope of a second chance under Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Under the terms of the original loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the forward, but it has since emerged that Monaco are willing to negotiate on the transfer fee after a disappointing season at United. Vasilyev added: ‘We are not in any other negotiations, even if big clubs are interested. The decision is with Manchester, then we will discuss with the player what he wants. I would like to have more visibility.’ Falcao missed last summer’s World Cup in Brazil following a knee injury and it is thought he rushed his recovery in an attempt to play in the tournament for Colombia. Under the terms of the loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the striker but Monaco are willing to negotiate . Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward spoke with Monaco president Vasim Vasilyev on Sunday . Vasilyev added: ‘He had mishaps in Monaco. He had problems with the coach Claudio Ranieri, there was a lack of understanding. ‘He was also seriously injured and missed the World Cup. In late August, he came to tell us that he wanted to play at a higher level.” Ranieri has since been replaced by Leonardo Jardim and he has backed Falcao to rediscover his goalscoring form after a frustrating season at United. Jardim, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Juventus in the Stade Louis II, is preparing for his return at the end of the season. Jardim, speaking ahead of his side's home clash with Juventus, is confident Falcao can get back to his best . The Portuguese coach said: ‘He’s not had a great season that is true, but I’m sure he can come back to the levels he was at in the past - that much I’m convinced about. ‘It’s not a question for me, but for the players, I’ve only worked with him for a month.’ Monaco lost the first leg last week in the Juventus Stadium to a controversial penalty and face Massimiliano Allegri’s team in the second leg.

An aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed Germanwings passenger plane may had its electronics 'hacked' before it crashed killing all 150 on board. The theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected Financial Times newspaper from aviation boss Matt Andersson, president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace. The French Alps tragedy which occurred on the flight between Barcelona to Dusseldorf has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28. He is believed to have barricaded himself in the cockpit of the GermanWings A320 Airbus before flying the packed plane into the mountainside as the captain fought desperately to get inside. Scroll down for video . Disaster: An aviation expert says an external factor like 'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the Germanwings plane crash that claimed 150 lives . Tragedy: The crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who investigators say locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet . Investigation: But Matt Andersson - president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace - says any number of causes could have caused the crash . Doomed: Recordings from the cockpit suggested that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (left) locked himself in the cockpit while the Captain Patrick Sondenheimer desperately tried to break in . Investigators point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer. Mr Andersson says the French accident investigators are clear that the stricken plane 'accelerated in its descent'. But he writes in the FT: 'That may be, but it could be from any number of causes, including external electronic hacking into the aircraft's control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception.' 'This is one reason military and head-of-state aircraft are generally installed with specific shielding and additional active protective measures,' and he stresses: 'Civilian aircraft are not.' Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries and come to a firm conclusion. He added: 'The public should patiently wait for a through, multi-party professional air safety investigation, while maintaining an independence of judgment over preliminary official hypotheses.' Setting out his doubts about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary findings, Mr Andersson said: 'Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) of the Germanwings flight 9525 have yet to be subject to international standards. 'Until they are, many broad assertions currently presented to the public may turn out to be erroneous, misleading or in some cases lead to improper or counterproductive regulatory and other reactions –including misplaced liability, financial and insurance claims.' Damaged: Despite revelations from the plane's flight data recorders (pictured), Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries . Aftermath: He claims passenger planes do not have the same level of protection as military jets and someone could have hacked into its 'control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception' Since the crash, European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck, requiring a member of cabin crew to step in if one of the two pilots leaves the cockpit. Mr Andersson writes in the FT that the 'slow drip' of piecemeal judgments from preliminary assessments of data can be counterproductive. He said the European Cockpit Association representing nearly 40,000 professional pilots 'has rightly criticised the premature release' of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder. Investigators say this highlights the co-pilot breathing while locked in the cockpit while the pilot beats on the door outside. Protection: Since the crash which is believed to be caused by 28-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck . Police carried out forensic searches on Lubitz's and his parents house after it emerged that he 'deliberately' crashed the Airbus A320 jet into the Alps . He believes premature release 'could arguably prejudice a formal technical assessment' and Mr Andersson is not the only aviation expert to speculate on the plane being 'hacked'. Former commercial pilot Jay Rollins told US television channel MSNBC last month: 'This aircraft is highly computerised. 'There's one possibility that no-one has brought up. I wonder – could this be a hacking incident?' He drew parallels with the loss of a US drone over Iran, which some blamed on electronic hacking: 'Suddenly the aircraft responding to outside forces. 'If something like that were going on it would be very disturbing for the pilot.'

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same "situations" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'

Designer Lilly Pulitzer's family learned that it's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the 'Pink Sunday' rush for the late Ms Pulitzer’s eponymous brand’s brightly-colored, limited edition collaboration at Target. The 250-piece Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the #LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party .

Protesters have demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons during a protest against the gentrification of South London. The store front of its Brixton branch was covered in shattered glass while 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' was spray painted in black across their housing advertisements. A police spokesman confirmed that one man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Thousands of people turned up for the event organised by the Reclaim Brixton group who were demonstrating against local residents and businesses being priced out of the trendy area. One of the event's organisers denounced the violent actions of 'one idiot' but told MailOnline there could be a reason Foxtons - which has a reputation for selling expensive homes - has been 'continuously targeted'. Scroll down for video . Vandal: One vandal smashed the front window of Foxtons Brixton branch (pictured) during a 'wholly peaceful' protest against rising house prices in London . Violent: The lone protester demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons, who have a reputation for selling expensive houses . Defaced: The vandal then spray painted 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' on the estate agent's housing advertisements . Reputation: A spokesperson for Reclaim Brixton - who organised the event - denounced the man's violent actions but suggested there could be a reason Foxtons is 'continuously targeted' Motive: Cyndi Anaso said she is not happy about the vandalism but told MailOnline 'it suggests there's a reason they are being targeted' Response: Police at the scene in Brixton (pictured) had to us CS spray to disperse a group of violent protesters . Cyndi Anaso from Reclaim Brixton told MailOnline said she was 'saddened' that someone behaved 'deviantly' during a wholly peaceful demonstration. But she claims the upmarket estate agents have been targeted before, adding: 'Foxtons has a very poor reputation when it comes to expensive properties and unfortunately.' 'There's a message in it which I'm not happy about but it still suggests there's a reason they are being targeted. 'There's never an endorsement of the attack but nothing else on the day can be considered even slightly violent.' 'I don't even think it's right to apologise for these individuals because every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window.' Foxtons is widely considered as a sign of gentrification and its presence is an indicates that an area either is or has the potential to become very affluent. The Reclaim Brixton event was planned to demonstrate against the rising property prices in London which the group believes is 'displacing the city's communities'. A statement on the Facebook page for the event said: 'The fight against gentrification starts here! Brixton is widely known for its vibrancy, which is another word for social and cultural diversity. Keeping watch: There is still a 'police presence' outside the vandalised store in Brixton, South London following the incident . Defence: Sympathisers and Brixton locals used Twitter to condemn the attention being given to the 'isolated' act of vandalism . Break-in: The Metropolitan Police (pictured) also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall, but were removed shortly after and no arrests were made . 'But Brixton's vibrancy now has a question mark on it. Will Brixton turn into a living museum or will it live?' But alongside images of people protesting peacefully on the streets, social media has been flooded with images of hordes pushing past police and the Foxtons window being destroyed. A police spokesman added: 'A group of protesters then made their way to Brixton Road where the window of a commercial premises was smashed and graffiti sprayed on the building.' Police used CS spray on 'a small group of protesters' who went into Brixton Police Station at around 4.10pm before being removed shortly afterwards. The Metropolitan Police also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall at around 3.15pm, saying: 'Officers entered the building and the protesters were removed.' Grace Lally from Lambeth Housing Activists said the demonstration had attracted thousands of people. Smashed: A Reclaim Brixton spokesperson said: 'Every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window' She added: 'The protest has been lively and strong and loud and people have hung banners off the town hall, blocked the streets and marched through Brixton a number of times and stopped traffic.' Ms Lally insisted the protest was 'really lively' but there had been 'no violence or trouble or anything like that'. Those sympathetic to Reclaim Brixton's protest and locals of the area have taken to Twitter to denounce isolated incidents of violence. Regarding the smashed window, Vanessa Furey from London said: 'Whilst sympathetic to the sentiment, idiots who have done this will have taken away what Reclaim Brixton was about.' And Louise Ridley wrote: 'I live in Brixton. I want people to know about extortionate rents and evictions. But I don't want windows smashed, anywhere.'

(CNN)Pushed to his limits, a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class. In an email to his students, Irwin Horwitz accused them of "backstabbing, game playing, cheating, lying, fighting." The professor at the Texas A&M University Galveston Campus expected his missive would create some conflict, but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly. Those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage. The story went viral. Suddenly, his name was spreading on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, accompanied by the kind of strong, unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you've never met. He was a hero who taught today's entitled youth a much-needed lesson, or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit. One thing was certain: He, and his employer, were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for. "I did what I did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the Internet," Horwitz said. "I will stand by what I did, but I'm not career suicidal." Texas A&M says Horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching. But Horwitz, a nontenure-track professor in the maritime administration program, is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs. Horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial, and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class. The day before writing to his students, Horwitz wrote a similar email to the CEO of the Texas A&M Galveston Campus and to the school's chief academic officer. "I have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful, dishonest and disrespectful" as his current strategic management class, he wrote to the administrators. He accused the students of shirking responsibility, making excuses and complaining their way to better grades. He would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class, Horwitz wrote. "The class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic," he wrote. "But they are your problem now." It was the next day that Horwitz wrote to the students, calling the class "an embarrassment in general," and said that "I am frankly and completely disgusted." Once his words echoed in traditional and social media, the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone. The story was such a talker that even The Onion offered a parody. "I'm not looking to fail students," Horwitz said. "I don't get a bonus for failing students." "The letter sounded a little bit more definite than I wanted it to," he added. He never actually changed anyone's grade. There were some students he wasn't going to fail, he said, and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out. But Horwitz stands by his tough stance; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed, he said. The course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses. "I had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break-even analysis," the professor said. "If you cannot do a break-even analysis, then you don't deserve a bachelor's degree in business." His other complaint was about professionalism. Horwitz said students would swear at him, cheat and spread rumors about him online. This is related to their grades, he said, because dealing with people you don't like is a business skill. On online message boards, users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story. One purported student called Horwitz "a little obnoxious," but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules. Should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral? The fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public, but maybe there is more to it. The situation hits on a popular argument on the media and Internet: What do we think of millennials? Reflecting on his most recent class, Horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered. He mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics, and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration. The other factor is a failure of K-12 education, said Horwitz, who has met college students who don't know how to convert fractions to decimals. "What I'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance," he said. In a statement, Patrick Louchouarn, the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at Texas A&M Galveston Campus, said the entire class will not be failed. "Each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester," Louchouarn said. "The university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies." The flurry of attention is unwelcome and Horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia. But it's likely his story will have a short shelf life. People probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline. But he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere. He said he feels a public shaming of sorts. Online public shaming has become a research topic of its own. People who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance. "This is really destroying my life," Horwitz said.

A northern Indiana pizzeria that closed after its owner said his religious beliefs wouldn't allow him to cater a gay wedding opened Thursday to a full house of friends, regulars and people wanting to show their support. 'It's a relief to get going again and try to get back to normal,' said Kevin O'Connor, owner of Memories Pizza. O'Connor closed the shop for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana. Scroll down for video . Full house: Many customers wait for service as Memories Pizza reopened for business on Thursday. A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours . Owner Kevin O'Connor closed the shop (seen on Tuesday)  for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law . O'Connor, the  61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming . O'Connor said the criticism hasn't changed his beliefs. He said gays are welcome in his restaurant in the small, one-traffic-light town of Walkerton, 20 miles southwest of South Bend, but that he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his Christian beliefs. 'I'd do the same thing again. It's my belief. It's our belief. It's what we grew up on,' he said. 'I'm just sorry it comes to this because neither one of us dislike any of those people. I don't hold any grudges.' A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours. O'Connor said he hasn't received the money yet, but said he plans to give some to charity and use some money to make improvements to the restaurant. The 61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. 'I enjoy it. I don't want to leave here,' he said. 'I want this to be something that my daughter can enjoy.' Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming. Anger: A protester is seen outside Memories Pizza in this photo with a sign that reads 'Bigots' Uproar: Protesters (like the ones seen here on March 28) have been upset over Indiana passing a new law, which critics said allows businesses the ability to refuse service to gay customers on religious grounds. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana . Family: O'Connor, seen with his daughter Crystal, says gays are welcome in his restaurant, but he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his beliefs . The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. O'Connor says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders . 'We were like, `Stop! Stop! Stop!'" she said. 'It was really making us uncomfortable,' her father said. The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. He says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders. There were no protests as of 7 p.m. Jeanne and Ken Gumm from outside LaPorte, about 20 miles northwest of Walkerton, said they had been waiting for the pizzeria to reopen so they could show their support. 'We couldn't wait to get down here," said Ken Gumm, 66, a tank truck driver. 'To us this whole thing isn't about gay marriage. It's mostly about freedom of religion.'

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today left the door open to a second referendum on Scottish independence before 2020. Before last year's historic vote, Scottish nationalists insisted it was a once-in-a-generation chance to decided on the future of the 300-year-old Union. But Ms Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' In September's vote, 55 per cent of Scots backed the idea of remaining in the United Kingdom. Alex Salmond said the vote was an 'opportunity of a lifetime' and two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: 'We have always said it's a once in a generation thing.' But in a series of TV election debates between Scottish leaders, Ms Sturgeon has shifted her position and today left open the possibility that the promise of another vote could be included in a future SNP manifesto. Under pressure she said that 'something would have to change' before she promised a referendum, and people would have to vote for it. She said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, there is not another referendum on the cards. 'In order for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future, something significant would have to change from the situation we had last year in the referendum.' Ms Sturgeon, who was campaigning in Paisley today, left open the idea of demanding a referendum in next year's Scottish Parliament elections . Opponents claim Ms Sturgeon had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on a referendum, after insisting last year's vote was a once in a generation event . During a fractious and at times shouty debate on BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged her to rule out another vote. Ms Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: 'You clearly don't want to tell people before they vote in this election, what will happen in the next election. 'You have a conference coming up in September, you have 80,000 new members who might be popping along, are you going to put a motion at your conference on this to put a referendum into your next manifesto?' Ms Sturgeon said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, I haven't published the 2016 manifesto. It will be this time next year before we publish the 2016 one.' Mr Rennie said the SNP leader had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on another referendum. He said: 'People need to know whether their vote for the SNP this time round will trigger a referendum in the SNP's manifesto in 2016. Nicola Sturgeon's refusal to answer this basic question makes clear that Scotland faces neverendum. 'It matters because during the referendum we know the SNP took their eye off the ball. As a result, public services were neglected. 'We have seen from Canada the economic impact of an uncertain constitutional environment. Quebec lost jobs and wealth. That damaged the province in the long term. I want a Scotland which builds a stronger economy and a fairer society, balancing the books and delivering more powers.' During a TV debate, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged Ms Sturgeon to come clean on her plans for Scotland . Ms Sturgeon later accused her opponents of 'reviving Project Fear'. The First Minister was questioned about SNP plans to increase Scotland's financial powers, which economists have suggested would leave a £7.6 billion spending gap, during a third televised election debate in under a week. Ms Sturgeon said that full fiscal autonomy would take several years to implement but with new powers Scotland would start growing its economy and revenues. She said: 'This week we've seen the Project Fear that dominated the referendum revived by these three unionist parties, trying to talk down Scotland and assert that we're not capable of running our own affairs.' Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said: 'This (the figure) didn't come from us. You're right in saying this came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It also came from a group of Scottish-based economists that projected the gap to be bigger.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: 'To make this £7.6 billion up Scotland would have to grow at twice the rate of the rest of entire advanced world, so how would you do that Nicola?'

A night of violence gave way to a day of mourning Sunday for a man who died after sustaining serious injuries while in the custody of Baltimore police. Over several hours on Sunday afternoon, a steady stream of mourners filed into the Vaughn Green East funeral home for a wake for Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who died a week after an encounter with police left him with grave spinal injuries. Mourners passed by Gray's silk-draped, white coffin where he lay dressed in a white shirt, black pants, white sneakers and an all-white Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap. Scroll down for video .

Mourners also gathered outside. Some held up signs that read, 'We remember Freddie' and 'Our Hearts Are With The Gray Family.' Melissa McDonald, 36, who said she was Gray's cousin, wore a shirt with 'Freddie Forever' printed on the back. She described her cousin as a nonviolent person. 'He didn't deserve to die the way he did,' she said. A number of mourners like Tina Covington, 46, said they didn't know the family but came to express their condolences. Covington said she has a son near Freddie Gray's age. Gray was detained on April 12 after he ran away from police. He asked for an inhaler as he screamed in pain during the arrest and requested medical attention, but was denied . Gray, who was arrested for carrying a switchblade knife, died a week after the incident from a severed spine . 'It hits home. It really does. It's a reality check,' said Covington, whose son is 27. Covington said that 'there is something going on in the police department that needs to change.' Gray's funeral is planned for Monday. At a church service earlier Sunday, Pastor Jamal Bryant told churchgoers, including members of Gray's family, at Empowerment Temple AME Church that 'somebody is going to have to pay' for Gray's death. Bryant told churchgoers that if 'you're black in America your life is always under threat.' Bryant also talked about the violence that erupted Saturday night during what began as a peaceful demonstration attended by more than a thousand people.

Sait Serkan Gurbuz, a photographer with Reuters, said police detained him as he was shooting photographs of the scuffle. He declined to comment further. A statement from Reuters said police also cited Gurbuz for failure to obey orders. 'We hope that the department will dismiss the citation and, going forward, respect the First Amendment right of the press to lawfully take images in the public interest,' Reuters said. Gray's wake was held a day after protests in Baltimore turned violent. Above, a man is kicked as he attempts to get up after being knocked down, following a march to City Hall on Saturday . Barricade: Police stand in helmets near Pratt Street after a march to City Hall for Freddie Gray, Saturday, April 25, 2015 in Baltimore . Roughly 1,200 protesters gathered at City Hall on Saturday afternoon, officials said, to protest Gray's death, which has prompted near-daily demonstrations since he died April 19. Gray was arrested one week before that when officers chased him through a West Baltimore neighborhood and dragged him into a police van. However, a smaller group splintered off and looted a convenience store and smashed storefront windows. A protester tossed a flaming metal garbage can toward police officers in riot gear trying to push back the crowd. Earlier, a group of protesters smashed windows of at least three police cars. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a long-time congressman representing Baltimore's 7th District, told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that there is deep frustration over the case. 'Mr. Gray died a week ago. And I think the thing that upset so many people was the fact that here's a young man. We still don't know exactly why he was arrested,' Cummings said. 'We do know that he was hollering out for aid. He was not given aid after being arrested. ... A lot of people are very, very frustrated as to trying to figure out what happened here, and it's very upsetting.'

Gathering at the ball game: Protestors gather outside of Oriole Park at Camden Yards before a baseball game between the Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles after a rally for Freddie Gray, Saturday, April 25, 2015, in Baltimore . Police acknowledged Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested — before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the Police Department's policy. Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray asked for medical help several times, beginning before he was placed in the van. After a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.

A volleyball-playing feline was picked to star in a national TV advert after seeing off competition from thousands of gifted animals. Tortoiseshell Mimi became an internet sensation after her owner uploaded clips of her playing the sport to Facebook. The 30-second-video was shared by thousands of people around the world and features the one-year-old cat playing with 15-year-old Joshua Teague. Joshua’s dad Phil, 56, a computer programmer, bought the cat with his wife Christine, 45, when she was eight-weeks-old in December 2013 from a seller who lived in Birmingham. Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert, which was broadcast last Wednesday (15), after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group earlier this month. He said: 'All the family were really excited to see the advert. Mimi the cat appears in a 30-second video showing her unique ball skills . 'We had everyone around so we could watch it together and we told all our friends that it was going to be on. 'I am really proud that our video was chosen out of thousands of entries. 'It was completely by chance that I uploaded the video on to the Pets At Home Facebook page. The cat is seen playing volleyball with 15-year-old Joshua Teague in the hallway . Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group . 'I just saw something on there asking people to share videos and pictures of their pets so that’s what I did. I didn’t even realise it was a competition. 'The video showed Mimi playing volleyball with my son where he would throw the ball at her and she would keep batting it back. 'I had no idea it was competition so I thought it was a joke when I received an email on April 1 saying our video had been chosen for a national commercial. Mimi is seen in the video batting the ball back to Joshua every time he throws it her way . 'This kind of thing just never happens. 'She is a very talented cat. She has done many times since. 'I think she could get her own TV show.' Administrative assistant Christine said: 'I didn’t even know Phil had uploaded the video on Facebook so I thought it was an April Fools’ joke when he told me about it. 'We normally just skip the adverts when we watch programmes but we made sure to watch this one. 'Although she’s only in the advert for a few seconds, it’s nice to see her on it. 'I never thought when I filmed the video that it would end up on TV.'

Controversial Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans is under attack again with experts warning his 'reworked' baby milk formula is dangerous to babies. Dietitians have singled out a 'happy tummy brew' in Evans' cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, because it contains almost five times the maximum vitamin A dose for a baby. The original recipe for the 'brew' contained more than 10 times the maximum daily intake of vitamin A for babies. Scroll down for video . The paleo diet has been one of the hottest diet trends around, with celebrity followers taking on the lifestyle . The Dieticians Association of Australia said the reworked formula still presents a threat to babies. 'This new infant 'brew' could seriously harm babies,' a spokeswoman for the Dieticians Association of Australia told News Corp Australia. 'The authors seem to have made a serious mistake with this second version of their liver and broth recipe, suggesting they do not understand the basic scientific and nutrition information relevant for infant feeding. 'They have said publicly that they have tried to make it safe by reworking the original recipe, and increasing the age for which it's suggested from 0-6 months to now be 6-12 months, but they have failed spectacularly to meet any safe standards.' The paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle . Evans's co-authors, wellness blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padrin, told Channel 7 last week the dangerous formula had been reworked and renamed 'Happy Tummy Brew'. The pair told the program the recipe had changed. 'We added vitamin C and some calcium,'Carr told The Morning Show. It comes after Evans' recently shared two stories on his social media accounts of women who claimed the paleo diet helped alleviate the symptoms of their multiple sclerosis. A 30-year-old woman, Hollie, wrote she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in September 2013. She said that she endured months of  constant dizziness, altered temperature perception, extreme fatigue, numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression. But after jumping on the Paleo diet bandwagon, Hollie claimed she has not suffered any MS symptoms over the past 12 months, her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever. Hollie's experience led the celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000-plus followers on Facebook on Saturday. Pete Evans has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis . 'WOW this is powerful story on MS, thanks for sharing Hollie.. it will make your heart sing.. it has mine, please tag and share wide!' Evans wrote. The Australian chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg, another MS sufferer. The woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on Evans' 10 weeks Paleo program. The celebrity chef has been a proud paleo advocate . 'I have had a lot of health issues the past years, mainly auto-immune stuff including MS,' she wrote in the online post. 'Having MS means I'm always sapped of energy, have numbness, pins and needles, pain, poor concentration, etc. Not any more!' Marg said she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs. 'No way on earth I could have done that 10 weeks ago,' she wrote. 'My concentration and memory is much better and I can also plan better. I'm not off my MS meds yet but I am off my Thyroid and Reflux meds. 'Thanks so much Pete and team for helping me get my life back. You've made this road so easy. As an added bonus I've gone from a size 16 to a size 12.' The My Kitchen Rules judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy. But, Hollie praised Evans for his endorsement of the controversial diet, and said 'the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable'. 'I have been inspired by your encouragement, great recipes and educated by the accurate information you provide,' Hollie wrote. 'Pete, I thank you so very much for bringing paleo in to the mainstream - people no longer look at me as though I'm a weirdo for following this way of life.' In another recent Facebook post, the Australian chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg who also suffers from MS . Evans has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman 'diet' LaTrobe University Associate Professor of Dietetics Catherine Itsiopoulos pointed out Hollie's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the Paleo lifestyle. 'Her diet may have been poor previously,' Dr Itsiopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we don't know what her diet and eating habits were like before. 'By eating lean meat, good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together. 'But we don't actually know if her condition is cured so it's hard to advocate on because there's no scientific evidence to back this up.' The paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar . University of South Australia Professor of Population, Health and Nutrition Kerin O'Dea said while the diet seemed to have worked for Hollie, it might not work for others. 'Pete can share whatever he likes to his followers but there's never going to be one magic bullet to cure an illness or a serious disease,' Dr O'Dea told Daily Mail Australia. 'Someone reporting an anecdote might be true in one person's case but it's very difficult to imply it to others, which can be quite misleading for people. The paleo style of eating, which Pete Evans is a proud supporter of, has been sweeping across the globe . 'They could feel failure when it doesn't work for them, especially when they try to cure a serious condition like this. 'I wouldn't recommend any particular diet for anyone suffering any type of illnesses.' The paleo style of eating, which Evans is a proud supporter of, has swept  the globe and involves a high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruits, seeds and nuts.

(CNN)A popular Chinese television host known for impromptu satire is now the subject of controversy after being caught on camera cursing the late Chairman Mao Zedong. Bi Fujian, who works for state-run China Central Television, was filmed at a dinner party singing a revolutionary song that eulogizes the Communist Party's early years when he started going off script. "The Communist Party, Chairman Mao. Don't mention that old son of a b***h. He made us suffer so bad," went Bi's improvised lyrics. The other dinner guests burst into laughter. Bi later apologized. "My personal speech has led to grave social consequences, and I feel remorseful for that. I hereby sincerely apologize to the public. As a public figure, I shall learn the lesson from this incident, adhering to strict self-discipline," he posted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform. Making disrespectful references to China's leaders in public is considered a taboo in China, even today. And Bi's comment was directed at the man regarded by many as the country's founding father -- despite his controversial reputation. The 75-second video clip, seemingly filmed on the cellphone of another dinner guest, was uploaded on Monday. Since then, it has been removed from video-sharing sites inside China, although it was still accessible on Weibo. It's unclear when the incident occurred, or what the relationsip was between the camera person and Bi. CCTV said it would investigate. "As a CCTV presenter, Bi Fujian's speech in the online video has led to grave social consequences," the network said in a statement posted on its Weibo account. CCTV did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Fondly known as "Grandpa Bi," the 56-year-old TV personality was born and grew up in the Mao era. The song Bi riffed on was part of a "red" Peking opera that was first performed in the late 1950s. It was popularized during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s -- which was launched by Mao -- when China was torn apart by violence and social unrest. The video quickly divided China's online community. Critics said Bi, as an influential public figure, deserved a harsh punishment. But others rushed to his defense, arguing that Bi was simply enjoying himself in a private setting and was set up by whoever uploaded the clip. The video also emerged just a day before the new head of CCTV started his job, leading some to wonder if it were a case of "a new broom sweeps clean." Mao still divides opinion in China. His giant portrait hangs on Beijing's Tiananmen Gate, and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital. But despite this reverence, Mao's is a deeply flawed legacy. Many remember him as a brutal dictator who inspired fear, paranoia and famine, and whose actions resulted in tens of millions of deaths. CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report.

Less than two days later Marissa Holcomb was fired . Hold up: The robber managed to get $400 cash from the till, which Popeyes said is too much money to have kept in the register. They said it is not the first time Holcomb had got in trouble for not clearing the till . 'I just had a gun to me. I'm not paying the money,' Holcomb told KHOU. 'I don't think it's right because now I'm struggling for my family because what I had to do to keep my life. 'I mean who's gonna call me? I'm five months pregnant.

A man vying to become the next Kentucky governor has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after a late local celebrity who bid five times for the title but never won enough votes. The 68-year-old Pulaski County resident, who was known as Terrill Wayne Newman until Tuesday, told the Lexington Herald-Leader he doesn't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will 'warm Galbraith's grave.' His predecessor, who died in 2012 from chronic emphysema, gained a following for his wit, sharp dress sense and support of legalizing marijuana. Terrill Wayne Newman (right), who is vying to become Governor of Kentucky, has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after the late local celebrity (left) who bid five times for the title but never won . The newly-christened Galbraith filed paperwork on Wednesday to run as an independent for the state's highest office. The Secretary of State's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by August 11 to get their names on the general election ballot. Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said. Galbraith says he and the late Galbraith were 'not friends per se,' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis. Dea Riley, who was the original Galbraith's running mate in 2011, said she thinks he would find the whole name change amusing. 'I can hear him now: "I'll tell the IRS to send him the tax bill,"' Riley said. But she also said the new Galbraith 'has very big shoes to fill' with his name and she hopes he will honor it. 'To have Gatewood's name and message prostituted, for the sake to garner political office, is a personal affront to me in that I was not only his running mate but equally his friend and confidant,' Riley said.

There looked to be so much bend on Leo Messi’s shot on the half hour at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night that if there had been no net to stop the ball it would kept on curling until it ended up back at the great man’s feet. The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted. Barcelona star duo Luis Suarez (right) and Lionel Messi embrace as Barcelona take a seven-point lead in La Liga . The Barcelona No 10 loses his markers in the Almeria penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike . Barcelona talisman Messi wheels away after opening the scoring  at the Nou Camp during a 4-0 victory over Almeria . Suarez followed Messi's lead by scoring a similar left-footed strike to double the Catalans lead with the first of his two goals . Barcelona defender Marc Bartra stuffs the ball under his shirt after netting a third with a headed goal on 75minutes . Barcelona (4-3-3): Bravo; Alves, Bartra, Mascherano, Adriano; Sergi Roberto, Xavi, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Pedro. Subs: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Mathieu, Pique, Iniesta, Rafinha, Neymar . Booked: Mascherano . Scorer: Messi 33', Suarez 55', Bartra 75', Suarez 90' Almeria (4-2-3-1): Julian; Ximo Navarro, Marin, Trujillo, Casado; Partey, Corona; Wellington Silva (Soriano), Espinosa (Mane), Edgar (Zongo); Bifouma. Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Julián Cuesta in the visitors’ goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Barça number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta’s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo’s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta’s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes.

Brazil full-back Dani Alves rushes to congratulate team-mate Messi after he gives Barcelona a first half lead . The Argentina phenomenon celebrates scoring his 33rd league goal of the season so far . Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria’s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona’s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury. If they don’t do you with the magic of Messi and Suarez then they do you from a dead ball. Almeria had succumbed to all three threats.

Sandra Garratt was in constant agony after undergoing two operations before her death . A grandmother racked with constant pain jumped from the top of a multi-storey car park to end her suffering, her devastated husband has said. Sandra Garratt, 56, went through two years of agony following two back operations for a slipped disc and not even morphine could dull the pain. Last month doctors told the housewife there was nothing more they could do ease her suffering and this was the 'final straw', according to her husband Steve. On Good Friday, the mother of two left her home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after telling her husband she was 'just popping out'. But he became anxious for her welfare and he called the police. At 2.35pm, police and ambulance crews were called to the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, where they discovered Mrs Garratt's body. She had fallen more than 50ft from the top of an Asda supermarket multi-storey car park. Mr Garratt, 57, told how he gave up his job as a community transport driver last year to care for his wife. He said her suffering had intensified in the last 18 months of her life and the pain had spread to her legs, feet and fingers. He added: 'She was in pain every minute of every day. She was a happy lovely person but withdrew from her happy family life. 'Before there had been hope but when there was nothing they could do, it was the final straw. 'Everybody says the same – she is now free from the pain. That's the only bit of comfort. 'The doctors and GPs, within the scope of the NHS waiting lists and everything that goes on, did everything they could.' Mrs Garratt leaves behind daughter Lucy, 37, son Jonathan, 26, and two grandchildren, Joshua and Jessica. The coroner has been informed of her death. Mrs Garratt told her husband she was 'popping out' on Good Friday. Hours later her body was found at the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, West Midlands .

A young Star Wars fan, who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies’ creator George Lucas asking whether he would allow Jedi Knights to marry in the future, was elated to receive a reply granting his request. Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric told Inside Edition: 'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy was on hand to film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son, who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It’s very black and white. There’s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don’t have emotions, but they do. It’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'

The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 at auction. The unique psychedelic cartoon, which is hand-painted, depicts the eponymous submarine from the 1968 film in which the Fab Four travel to Pepperland to save it from the Blue Meanies. The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas, Texas, on Thursday . The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the Yellow Submarine film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The 1968 film starred The Beatles (above) It features handwritten notes instructing artists on the correct colours to use when recreating the submarine. More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch £10,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time. Yellow Submarine was a success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album a year later . The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. The original cel is set to sell for £10,000 . 'It is a film that has stood the test of time and is as relevant today as when it was made in 1968. The Band Concert is the most expensive cel sold . The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported £280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference. 'It would be one of the earliest final versions of the Yellow Submarine hand-painted - it really is the holy grail of Yellow Submarine memorabilia. 'Since small stickers were used for when the sub travelled there are not really a great deal of Yellow Submarine cels out there. 'This comes from a former Yellow Submarine ink and paint department employee. 'It is an unusually large image. Colour model cels were used also to help determine the final approved colour scheme of the yellow submarine. 'Colour model cels from this film are very rare, and this is one of the single best cels of the Yellow Submarine we have seen.' The Animation Art Signature Auction will take place in Dallas, Texas on April 9.

A terminally-ill landlord whose dying wish was to marry his partner of 26 years saw their special day descend into farce after a series of blunders. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home. But, instead of having the magical day they had planned, the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly. Guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over, and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather, 54, after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple's special day (pictured) was full of blunders . Guests at the couple's (pictured) wedding were forced to listen to the song 'Wonderful Life' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on, rendering it invalid . Mr Haigh, who died weeks after the ceremony in November last year, was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he'd let her down. In fact, the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House in the city centre, where the pair said their vows. Mrs Haigh, 54, said: 'Geoff was heartbroken by it all. He kept apologising to me and saying he'd wished we'd got married years earlier and done it properly. 'He was devastated, as the way he saw it, this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness.' The couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once Mr Haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal. However, the landlord of The Ram's Head pub, in Oldham, was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely. The pair then settled upon the Manchester venue as it was not too far from their home. It took three people two hours to get Mr Haigh ready for his big day and, determined to make the day perfect for his bride-to-be, he battled through pain to make it to the venue. Mrs Haigh, 54, said every guest at the ceremony -  held in November last year in Manchester  -  wrote a letter of complaint. She has three marriage certificates (pictured) as the first two were riddled with errors . The couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony (pictured) and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date. An amended version posted later was full spelling errors . However, it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began. They said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down. Then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows, which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar. Mrs Haigh, a mother of three, said: 'There was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after I asked I was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day. Geoff Haigh and his wife Heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day. 'It felt like they were merely using us a practice go, like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them.' After the bride and groom said their vows, guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music 'Wonderful Life' while the registrar went out of the room. Unbelievably, almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before Mrs Haigh was compelled to take action. She said: 'Everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on. We couldn't believe it. 'It had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now.' After the ceremony, as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant San Carlos, the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate. They were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected, otherwise their marriage was invalid. Mrs Haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead. However, when the second certificate arrived in the post, it was addressed to Mrs Haigh in her maiden name 'Taylor' and included spelling errors on the document. A third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple. Mr Haigh (above) passed away in January this year, just weeks after his wedding to long-term partner Heather. The couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year . Mrs Haigh (left) said her new husband (right) was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down. She has received £137 from the Manchester register office following the calamity day . Mrs Haigh said: 'It felt like they didn't recognise we were married and that really hurt Geoff before he died. 'It made if feel like the whole thing didn't happen, like it meant nothing at all. It was devastating. 'The guests were all in tears for us. They were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously.' The newlyweds were offered a £137 refund but Mrs Haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough 'loss' to warrant compensation. She said: 'It wasn't about the money, but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband. 'It was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more. They said "we all make mistakes and we are only human". 'That's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man's dying wish and the most special day of our lives, that attitude is not acceptable.' The wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House (pictured)  in the city centre, where the pair said their vows . The family has since received an apology from Manchester City Council, which runs the register office based at Heron House. A spokesman said: 'I'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs Taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations. 'These types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious. They understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding.' However, tragically, Mr Haigh died on January 4 this year before receiving the apology. His wife added: 'Geoff was determined not to die over Christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come, and he didn't want that for us. The energy it took from him to hang on, I couldn't believe.'

Washington (CNN)This week is the 100th anniversary of what many historians acknowledge as the Armenian genocide -- the Turkish massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians . And it's also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word "genocide" to describe the atrocity. It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word "genocide" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a "genocide" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago . In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. "The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence," he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. "We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians . In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. "No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on," she wrote.

Jailed millionaire Robert Durst pleaded not guilty Tuesday to the newest charge against him - a federal charge of possessing a gun after a felony conviction. U.S. District Judge Lance Africk set a trial date for June 22. Durst is an estranged member of the wealthy family that operates 1 World Trade Center. He also faces a murder charge in California and two state weapons charges in Louisiana - one of possessing a .38-caliber revolver after a felony conviction and one of possessing the firearm along with an illegal drug: about 5 ounces of marijuana. Claiming innocence: Suspected murderer Robert Durst appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to a new charge of gun possession. Pictured above leaving federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana in handcuffs after the court appearance . Durst pleaded guilty to two federal charges in Pennsylvania in 2004: possessing a firearm while a fugitive and while under indictment. However, his lawyers say those convictions don't make it illegal for him to carry a gun under Louisiana law. The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of 55-year-old Susan Berman, a longtime friend -allegedly because she was going to talk to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. He was arrested early March 15, less than 12 hours before HBO aired the final segment of 'The Jinx,' in which - off camera in a bathroom but with the microphone still live - Durst whispers, 'There it is. You're caught!' After about 10 other short sentences and disjointed phrases, he says, 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' Durst was arrested last month on suspicion of the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. The two pictured together above . It's believed that Durst killed Berman because she was about to speak to investigators about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife Kathleen McCormack. Pictured together above . Tuesday's hearing had its own bizarre moment when prosecutor Mike McMahon asked Durst if he understood the maximum penalties he faced if convicted. Durst responded: 'And you are?' Durst's attorney and the judge then explained to him who McMahon was. Durst is being held without bail in a state prison where the Orleans Parish mental ward is located, because the sheriff's office says experts found him a suicide risk. Defense attorneys and prosecutors met with a different federal judge last week to discuss another federal matter: whether two FBI agents and a state trooper on an FBI task force should be held in contempt of court for failing to show up at a hearing last week before the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court magistrate. Federal prosecutors moved that part of the case to federal court Monday; Durst's attorneys have not filed their response and have said they would not comment until they do. Durst's lawyers say his arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the conclusion of 'The Jinx.' Durst had registered at the Marriott under the name Everette Ward and was lying low while HBO aired the final chapter of his life story. Authorities said they found a passport, a head-and-chest latex mask, a handgun and marijuana in his room. His lawyers say it was searched illegally.

A Montana judge who was censured by the state's high court for his comments about a 14-year-old rape victim has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that former state District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors. Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher. Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. At Rambold's August 2013 sentencing, Baugh said Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold, the Billings Gazette reported at the time. Baugh, per the newspaper, described the teenage girl as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth. Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. Scroll down for video . Selected: Former District Judge G. Todd Baugh has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. He sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that a 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher . Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence. Legal case: Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez (right) shared some responsibility for her rape by teacher Stacey Rambold (left) Baugh, who served almost 30 years as a state judge, stepped down last year after being censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days. He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he didn't know who nominated him for the achievement award. He also repeated his assertion that media reports about the rape case had not told the whole story. 'I'm not trying to say I didn't make any mistakes. If you go into all the mistakes that were made, it would give a better-balanced report,' Baugh said. Fehr said Baugh had been nominated for the award by members of the bar association, but she declined to say who that was or why he was chosen. Case: Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence . Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. Baugh later apologized for his remarks. He was also censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days . Marian Bradley, Northwest regional director for the National Organization for Women, said the award was inappropriate given Baugh's conduct on the bench. Regardless of his prior accomplishments, Bradley said the Rambold case cannot be overlooked. 'The last chapter in his career, he put himself out there and did not protect a young girl and did not protect a community,' Bradley said. 'Giving him a lifetime achievement award is going to send people into tailspins.' Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. In December, state District Judge Russell Fagg wrote in a column for the Billings Gazette that Baugh handled more than 30,000 cases in his career. 'He has made thousands of good calls, and a few bad calls, as have all of us,' Fagg wrote. 'Bottom line: Baugh is a wonderful person.'

Kelly Ripa has been grief stricken following the sad news that her friend, cosmetic surgeon Dr Fredric Brandt, was found dead by suicide at his Miami mansion on Sunday. So it's understandable that 44-year-old TV star was looking morose as she left her New York City apartment on Tuesday. The Live With Kelly & Michael co-host, who is usually seen smiling, wore a frown as she left the building alone. When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life.' Sad day: Kelly Ripa looked to be in mourning on Tuesday as she left her NYC apartment; on Sunday it was announced her surgeon friend Dr Fredric Brandt had died . The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice.' The former soap opera actress was dressed casually in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on. The beauty was carrying her coat as well as some papers, a cell phone and her purse. Casual look: The former soap opera actress was dressed down in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look.

Madonna and Stephanie Seymour were clients. 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer,' the star wrote. Her husband Mark Consuelos, retweeted choreographer Isaac Calpito's post, which read: 'Devastated over the loss of our dear friend @drfredricbrandt. You are missed. You are loved. The world has lost one of its kindest souls.' They were close: Dr  Brandt was remembered by  Ripa (left with the surgeon in 2011) in a tweet on Monday following his tragic suicide at his Miami home on Sunday . Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.' The City of Miami Police Department confirmed that Dr Brandt's death on Sunday was a suicide by hanging. An autopsy was scheduled on Monday, the coroner confirmed. Miami Herald columnist, Lesley Abravanel had said Brandt had been 'devastated' recently over rumors comparing him to a character on the Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Her note: The 44-year-old beauty's tweet said, 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer' Abravanel, a Miami Herald columnist, posted a series of tweets on Sunday claiming that he had been 'devastated' by unflattering comparisons to Dr Franff on the  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, according to  sources close to the doctor. The doctor's longtime publicist Jacquie Tractenberg told The New York Post on Monday: 'The show definitely deeply hurt him, he was being made fun of because of the way he looks. 'It is mean, and it was bullying. But the show was not the reason for his depression, and it was not the reason he would take his own life.' The Tractenberg & Co PR agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. Was he bullied?: Dr  Brandt (left) has a resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly 'devastated' by the portrayal . His colleague, Dr Robert Anolik, who worked with Brandt at his practice, posted a moving tribute on Monday. The acclaimed dermatologist wrote: 'Dr. Fredric Brandt died yesterday. For nearly 5 years, Fred and I worked side by side. He was far more than a colleague to me. He was a close friend. I will miss him every day.' The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami by his housekeeper where he lived alone. She called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. The New York Post also wrote a column last month comparing the real-life doctor to the fictional doctor on Tina Fey's hit comedy. 'Sources: Dr Fredric Brandt was "devastated" over comparisons to the protagonist on Tina Fey’s new Netflix show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt",' Abravanel tweeted. Behar tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed' An eye for art: Dr Brandt, a cosmetic dermatologist and well-known art collector pictured in front of a piece from his collection at his apartment in New York City on March 7, 2014 . Dr Franff only appears in one episode, titled 'Kimmy Goes To The Doctor!', of the first season. The character shares Dr Brandt’s smooth skin, platinum blond hair and enthusiasm for plastic surgery, but his door sign claims he’s a ‘board certified D, DS, DDSOBGYN’, rather than a cosmetic dermatologist. The Dr Franff character is depicted on the Netflix show with a high-pitched laugh and unable to speak certain words due to his plastic surgery. He is also seen drinking  from a surgical bag and reinflates his own face after being punched. Netflix had no comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy.

Moscow (CNN)A Russian TV channel aired Hillary Clinton's first campaign video with a rating stamp that means it's for mature audiences, because of fears it might run afoul of the country's anti-gay propaganda law. A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. "There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't," a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. "Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video)." Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, "I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about." The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that "gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights." Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as "a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia." Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. "I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them," Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). "We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone," he said before the 2014 Games. "That's why you can feel safe and free here," he added, "but please leave our children in peace." The rights group ILGA-Europe said in a May 2014 report that Russia was the worst place in Europe (out of 49 countries) for LGBTI people to live.

A Pennsylvania couple have been killed after their 1923 Model T Ford convertible skidded off the roadway and flipped over. Ralph Cramer, 70, and his wife, Lynn, 59, were returning home from the Creekside Café in Mount Joy at about 9 p.m. on Sunday when the accident occurred. First responders arrived to find that the couple had died from multiple traumatic injuries suffered in the crash. Ralph Cramer, 70, and his wife, Lynn, 59, were returning home from the Creekside Café in Mount Joy at about 9 p.m. on Sunday when the accident occurred . Manheim Borough Police Chief Joseph Stauffer told Lancaster Online that the vehicle left the road, flipped over and landed upside-down in a ditch. It was not immediately known who was driving or if the couple had worn seat belts. The top was down when the wreck occurred. Stauffer says there's evidence the vehicle started to skid at a slight left turn, then went off the road and hit an embankment near a barn. The vehicle had been rebuilt or restored, with new elements. 'There are no indicators of what caused the accident yet,' said Stauffer. The investigation continues and Manheim police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

(CNN)A French-language global television network regained control of one of its 11 channels Thursday after a cyberattack a day earlier crippled its broadcasts and social media accounts. Television network TV5Monde was gradually regaining control of its channels and social media outlets after suffering what the network's director called an "extremely powerful cyberattack." In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. On a mobile site, which was still active, the network said it was "hacked by an Islamist group." ISIS logos and markings appeared on  TV5Monde social media accounts. But there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group. As day broke Thursday in Europe, the network had regained the use of one of its 11 channels and its Facebook page, Paul Germain, the chain's editor in chief, told BFMTV, a CNN affiliate in France. However, by late morning, a number of pages on the network's website had messages saying they were under maintenance. The outage began around 8:45 p.m. Paris time (2:45 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. TV5Monde offers round-the-clock entertainment and news programming that reaches 260 million homes worldwide, according to the Ministry of Culture and Communications. It functions under a partnership among the governments of France, Canada and Switzerland, as well as the Wallonia-Brussels Federation. Other networks that provide content to TV5Monde include CNN affiliates France 2 and France 3, France 24 and Radio France International.

A singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner. Captured in a front room in Bahama, North Carolina, the three dogs – a Husky called Sky, a brown and white Springer Spaniel called Sadie and a black and white Springer Spaniel called Marshall – take their positions on their make-shift stage. Getting the tune underway, Sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on Sky’s ear as if whispering something – Sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction. The video begins with Sadie the Springer Spaniel barking and interacting with the Husky named Sky . The Springer Spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the Husky joins it, but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl. Following the Husky’s lead, the Spring Spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another. Meanwhile the other Springer Spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner. No, it's like this! The Husky begins howling, causing the Springer Spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead . All together now! The three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony . Before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl, which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo. The trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder. The howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs – who continue to wag their tails – showing any signs of letting up. No encore? The owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise . Eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying: ‘Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.’ And the three dogs, rather put out about being interrupted, stopping and turning to look at him in surprise.

Former Holland forward Dirk Kuyt is returning to Feyenoord next season, aiming to end his professional playing days at the club that was a launching pad for nine years at Liverpool and Fenerbahce, the Rotterdam club announced Friday. Kuyt signed a one-year contract with Feyenoord, who are currently third in the top-flight Eredivisie, but said his stay will likely be longer. Kuyt grew into a favorite among Feyenoord's fanatical fans during his first stint with the club from 2003-2006, after transferring from Utrecht. He was the Eredivisie's top scorer in the 2004-2005 season and was named Dutch footballer of the year in 2006. Dirk Kuyt (left) is returning to Feyenoord, nine years after leaving the Dutch Eredivsie club for Liverpool . Kuyt retired from international football in October after finishing third with the Netherlands at last year's World Cup - a tournament where he underscored his versatility by playing on the wing and at left back. He made 104 appearances for the Netherlands and scored 24 goals. He also was part of the team that finished second in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, losing to Spain in the final. The 34-year-old said now is a good time to return to Rotterdam as "I'm fit and have a great drive to make a success of my time at De Kuip," Feyenoord's stadium. Feyenoord director Martin van Geel said that although Kuyt signed only a one-year deal both he and the club intend his stay in Rotterdam to be longer. "Dirk can keep going for years," Van Geel said. "As far as he's concerned, he can become the Ryan Giggs of Feyenoord and we will add many more years. This will be music to the ears of all Feyenoord fans." The forward has had a successful career for Liverpool, Fenerbache and playing for his country .

While it might be the nation's largest grocer, Walmart Supercenter was ranked at the bottom of the barrel  in a recent survey of America's supermarkets. The retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in Consumer Reports' annual survey, and this year it was rated number 67, the second worst supermarket. As it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine, Walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce. However, it was noted for its better-than-average prices. Walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in Consumer Reports' annual supermarket survey . The retailer (above a worker in the produce section of a Walmart in Miama) came in at number 67 followed by chain Waldbaum's, which was in last place . 'Every store I go in has room to improve,' said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a statement that the company released to Consumer Reports. 'I can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better. 'And if we nail those, one store at a time, our short-term performance gets better.' The respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness, food quality, freshness and staff courtesy. Walmart was joined by A&P (rated number 66) and Waldbaum's (number 68), which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed, according to CBS. The annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts, which was cited by a quarter of respondents. Other findings included: . Source: Consumer Reports . America's favorite supermarket, taking first place, is New York-based Wegmans. The retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness, baked goods and overall shopping experience. Publix came in second place followed by Trader Joe's, Fareway Stores and Market Basket. Wegmans was also among a total of three grocers, including Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, that earned outstanding produce scores. 'It's going to sound cliché, but our employees are our secret sauce,' Jo Natale, Wegmans' vice president of media relations told Consumer Report. Natale also shed light on the fact that Wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded, which 'allows us to take a long-range view, invest in people, and grow at a controlled rate.' While only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely  satisfied with the quality of their store's produce, meat and poultry offerings; nationwide, Consumer Reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings. Findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including Wegmans, Publix, Costco, Whole Foods and Fresh Market were considered standouts in this category. So as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $5,400 on food, what makes a supermarket the best? The survey noted that those who were the 'freshest' stores were usually the best  overall. Wegmans (file photo above) was rated America's favorite supermarket followed by Publix, Trader Joe's and Fareway Stores . In the past, check out speed and low prices might have satisfied customers, but the survey said they are now also demanding a wider variety of healthy, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. They also want more organics and local produce. 'There's a growing rejection of overly processed and packaged foods, especially among younger consumers,' says Willard Bishop's Jim Hertel.

A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, "Wow!"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.

(CNN)Thinking about presidential candidates?  Apparently, hormones are a major factor one should consider. According to one female businesswoman in Texas, Hillary Clinton shouldn't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she'll start an unnecessary war. When George W. Bush waged an unnecessary war in Iraq -- was his testosterone to blame? As Cheryl Rios, the CEO of Go Ape Marketing, sees it: "We're built differently, we have different hormones. In the world that we live in, I understand that there's equal rights and that's a wonderful thing and I support all of that. I don't support a woman being president." "With the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war," Rios wrote in a Facebook post. If Rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the Oval Office, she'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president. Throughout history, male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders' decision-making. Studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts. If science doesn't convince you, just Google "cheating politicians" for the long and sordid list of men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Sanford and John Edwards, whose hormones got the best of them. Rios has taken a lot of flak for her "biblically" inspired beliefs, but she's not the only one who's arguing that a woman's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern. Time magazine declared Hillary Clinton the "perfect" age to be president, because she's a postmenopausal woman who is "biologically primed" to lead. (She also happens to be a former first lady, senator and secretary of state.) I'm not joking. Believe me, I wish I were. No wonder Jon Stewart left "The Daily Show" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing. If discussions about a candidate's hormones are what we have to look forward to, the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed. But underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration: The bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015, a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias. We want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything. And you'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college, graduate school and the work force. But what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability, but a bias in how women and girls are viewed. Unfortunately, Cheryl Rios' view of women is not unique. Some people believe women have "our place" and that place is not at the table. They'll tell your daughter to "go for it" but believe she isn't qualified to fulfill her dreams. In a compelling series about women and work, Wharton School professor Adam Grant and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes. The evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless. It's overt: There are more men on corporate boards named John, Robert, William or James than there are women on boards altogether. The bias is also covert: When students rate their favorite professors, they describe the men as "geniuses" and the women as "nice." The bias is real, yet so many of us are blind to it. Hillary Clinton might not be the perfect candidate, but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the White House a much steeper climb. That's not just a problem for Democrats -- it's a problem for Republicans, Independents, everyone. The fact is, equality benefits everyone. It's better for the bottom line (companies with more women in leadership roles make more money).  It's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier, healthier, and more successful. It's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages.  And it's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results. Our nation, our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men. It's not enough to say to our daughters: "You can be anything you want to be." What we need to say is: "You can be anything you want to be, despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong." Rios said that if Clinton is elected, she is "moving to Canada" because "a female shouldn't be president."  Apparently Rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about Canada: Kim Campbell became the country's first female prime minister in 1993. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Canadians elected their first female prime minister, Kim Campbell.

Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after an evening in which their relegation into Sky Bet League One was marked by pre-match supporters' protests against Karl Oyston. Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation . Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen. 'We got off to a flyer and having got back to 1-1 I'm a little bit disappointed we didn't take anything on a horrible night on a horrible pitch.'

Real Madrid have 48 hours to make a decision on Javier Hernandez as the clock runs down on their first option to buy the Manchester United striker. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Monday that the European champions would take stock of Hernandez's situation at the end of the season. However, under the terms set out by United when they loaned the 26-year-old to Madrid, Thursday April 30 marks the end of the Spanish club's 'exclusivity period' to buy the player. Javier Hernandez is enjoying a fine run of form at Real Madrid - scoring three times in his last two games . Hernandez (centre) returned to training with his Real Madrid team-mates on Tuesday . Hernandez (second left) was all smiles in training, but the 26-year-old faces an uncertain future . From Friday they will no longer have first option and United will field offers of around £10million from West Ham, Southampton and Lazio. The Mexico striker who has scored three goals in his last two games has one year left on contract at Old Trafford, but his latest displays have boosted his valuation. Ancelotti said: 'It is a subject that we will evaluate at the end of the season. What I can say is that I have liked his professionalism during the whole year. He is enjoying his opportunity a lot, he has a high level of professionalism and for a coach to have these type of players that are always ready is very positive.'

(CNN)People magazine has anointed Sandra Bullock the world's most beautiful woman of 2015, the publication revealed on Wednesday. Bullock, 50, joins a long line of actresses to receive the honor, including last year's cover girl, Lupita Nyong'o, and Gwyneth Paltrow in 2013. She seems to be taking it all in stride, calling the whole thing "ridiculous." "Real beauty is quiet. Especially in this town, it's just so hard not to say, 'Oh, I need to look like that,' " she told People. "No, be a good person; be a good mom; do a good job with the lunch; let someone cut in front of you who looks like they're in a bigger hurry. The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying." The cover story focuses on Bullock's home life with her son, Louis, 5, and her efforts to stay healthy and fit past her 40s. "I was putting him to bed and told him that even when I'm old and gray and more wrinkly than I am now, I'll still love him and want to tuck him in," she said. "And he asked why I have wrinkles, and I said, 'Well, I hope some of them are from laughing so much.' And he touched my face and said, 'You're not old, you're just happy.' " The Oscar-winning star of movies including "Gravity," "The Blind Side" and "Crash" said she's happy with who she is. "As long as I'm healthy and strong and I don't let this mind of mine run amok with insecurities about what I am not, I can look in the mirror and like who I see." The selection of Bullock, the oldest woman to receive top honors in the history of the list, is a sign that beauty knows no age, say some. "Great choice! Gorgeous, talented, over 50 and FABULOUS! That's the way it's done!" wrote one fan on People's Facebook page. Also making the "most beautiful" cut this year: Gabrielle Union, Ariana Grande and Laverne Cox. The issue hits newsstands Friday.

Monday's events included sports and fitness zones, cooking demonstrations, and of course, the traditional egg roll. The egg roll is one of the longest-standing White House traditions.

'This is not selfie time,' Wesley said jokingly. 'Let the brother worship in the house of God.' Churchgoers traditionally walk around to shake hands and give hugs during the greetings and announcements portion of service, but the pastor encouraged the crowd to stay in their seats and greet only their closest neighbors, as the sanctuary was tightly secured with Secret Service agents. The choir - including women in purple dresses and men sporting purple ties - sang a lively rendition of the hymn 'He Lives,' stirring most of the church, filled to capacity, to clap, sing and sway in praise alongside the upbeat organ keys while ushers collected the tithes and offering.

People queued around the block for the service in Alexandria, monitored by federal security officers . The lively pastor based his sermon around a scripture from 1 Corinthians 15 on the life and resurrection of Christ. 'Where do you stand in the resurrection of Christ,' he asked. 'You either believe it or reject it.' Wesley said the sacrifices of Christ allowed the congregation to be forgiven for their own sins. 'He took the pain for me. I owe him my life. I owe him my praise. I owe him my hallelujah,' he said.

Jane Tipper had been walking her dog Molly when the eight-year-old chased a lamb over a cliff . A Border Terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall after chasing a spring lamb off the edge of  a cliff before spending three days stranded on a remote beach. Dog Molly had been on a walk with owner Jane Tipper and her daughter Hannah in Eype, Dorset, last week when the she fell over the cliff's edge along with the lamb. Molly survived a vertical drop of 100ft then rolled 150ft down a steep slope and coming to rest in gorse near the bottom. Her distraught owners managed to see that the eight-year-old had survived the drop, but had no way of getting down to the beach to get her. A team of ten coastguards arrived on the scene and a winchman was lowered down the cliff face but was unable to find her despite four hours of searching. Ms Tipper, who had been celebrating her 64th birthday, was forced to return home in nearby Charmouth without her beloved dog which she has had since she was a puppy. She contacted the website DogLost which arranged for missing posters to be put up in the area. Three days later, Molly was found in an exhaustive state after walking a mile further along the beach to an area popular with dog walkers. It is unclear what had happened, but luckily, she has come through her ordeal relatively unscathed - but there has been no sign of the lamb since the incident. Ms Tipper said: 'I was with my daughter, it was my birthday and we planned a short walk and lunch in a local cafe but we never got there. The border terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall, including a 100ft vertical drop, in Eype, Dorset, but her owner had no way of reaching her. Coastguards searched thoroughly but were unable to find her . 'Molly's usually very good, she doesn't chase animals. 'She fell about 200ft but the cliff was on a slight slope. I couldn't see her at the bottom but my daughter did so we knew she survived the drop. 'The coastguard winched one of them over the cliff and he went from side to side looking for her but couldn't see her. 'It's rocky there, there's thick patches of gorse and it's extremely dangerous. 'After a couple of hours they said they just couldn't spot her. They were very upset about it.' She added the incident left her 'completely numb'. 'We didn't stop searching at the end of the day,' she said. 'When I got home I phoned as many people as I could think of.' But fortunately, a female dog walker recognised Molly from the lost posters that had been put up in the area on Friday. After Ms Tipper put up missing dog posters, Molly was identified by a dog walker three days after going missing. Pictured right, the cliff face in Dorset where Molly fell . Ms Tipper added: 'The lady was walking her dogs when Molly followed her and sat next to her. She called me and we met up and fortunately it was Molly, I was worried it was going to be someone else's dog. 'Molly was very pleased to see me, especially when I got a gravy bone out of my pocket. 'She wasn't hurt or limping or anything, but she was shattered and spent the rest of the day asleep when we got home. 'I think it's really knocked the stuffing out of her. ' A coastguard spokesman urged dog owners to always keep their pets on lead while walking near the coast.

(CNN)Sawyer Sweeten grew up before the eyes of millions as a child star on the endearing family sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond." Early Thursday he committed suicide, his sister Madylin Sweeten said in a statement. He was 19. "This morning a terrible family tragedy has occurred," Madylin Sweeten said in a statement passed on by her manager Dino May. "We are devastated to report that our beloved brother, son, and friend, Sawyer Sweeten, took his own life. He was weeks away from his 20th birthday.  At this sensitive time, our family requests privacy and we beg of you to reach out to the ones you love." Sweeten, best known for his role Geoffrey Barone, was visiting family in Texas, entertainment industry magazine Hollywood Reporter reported, where he is believed to have shot himself on the front porch. Sawyer Sweeten was born in May 1995 in Brownwood, Texas. He was a year and a half old when he started on "Raymond," playing next to his real-life twin brother Sullivan, who starred as Michael Barone, according to the website IMDb. Their sister, Madylin, played their TV sister Ally Barone. The show was about the adults, and the children, especially the twins, had bit parts, adorable cameo moments. In the beginning, they were too young to speak. The series developed a loyal following and ran from September 1996 through May 2005. According to his IMDb profile, Sawyer did not appear to take on acting roles after "Raymond" was discontinued. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.

A video showing a man cracking a giant egg to reveal another fully formed egg inside, may be enough to scramble your brain. YouTube user Elman511 cracked open the over-sized egg that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ While the instance is extremely rare, it’s caused when the hen is in the process of forming an egg in her oviduct and another oocyte – the ovum or egg cell that becomes the yolk of the egg – is released too soon. Scroll down for video . Egg-traordinary: US YouTube user Elman511 cracked open an over-sized egg (shown on the left) that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ In the video, Elman511 cracks the egg, which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. He then cracks the smaller egg, which also has a yolk and white inside. ‘That’s the end of the nesting dolls of egg…an egg inside of an egg… crazy man,’ he said, before noting that the yolks look rich. Egg-citing: In the video, ‘Elman511’ cracks the egg (pictured), which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. The unusual occurrence is down to a counter-peristalsis contraction . This is when a second oocyte (yolk) is released by the hen's ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The unusual occurrence is called a counter-peristalsis contraction. A hen releases an oocyte from her left ovary into her oviduct every 18 to 26 hours, Back Yard Poultry Mag explained. Usually, the oocyte travels down the oviduct, adding layers of the egg until it’s laid through the hen’s vent. But in a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The phenomenon has been mentioned as far back as 1250 AD by the Dominican friar and polymath Albertus Magnus in his book De Animalibus. Ask the egg-spert: In a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. This results in an egg with another made inside it, producing two yolks (pictured)

(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for "lost" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the "holiday" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the "mistake" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the "war on women" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious "war on women" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The "war on women" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the "war on women" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative "solution" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.

Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge . A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman . 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'

An investigation has concluded Freddie Gray broke his neck after falling head-first into the back of the police van as it was moving, it was reported today. Medical and law enforcement sources briefed on the police investigation told ABC News Gray's 'catastrophic' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt 'in the back door of the van'. They claimed there was 'no evidence' Gray sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest, which was caught on camera on a street side on April 12. According to ABC's sources, Gray was standing in the van, bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door. It is believed he fell into the door, breaking his neck. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A report claims Freddie Gray broke his neck when he fell head-first into the back of the van as it was moving . Similar van: Freddie Gray was stood, bent over, with his head facing the back door of a van like this . Timeline? It is believed Gray fell head-first into the back of the van, breaking his neck, during the journey . Inside: The above diagram shows the inside the police van . Pictured: The second stop which police failed to report in their paperwork after the van journey, during which Freddie Gray sustained a 'catastrophic' head injury. It was picked up by a privately-owned security camera . According to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray . The news comes hours after Baltimore Police admitted the van transporting Gray made a previously unreported stop. The mysterious detail was picked up by a privately-owned security camera, and will be integral to the police investigation into Gray's death, which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on Thursday morning. It is not known why the van stopped at the corner of North Fremont Ave and Mosher Street before it made another two stops then finally transported Gray to the hospital. And police have yet to clarify why Gray would have been standing without a seat belt on. Just nine days before his arrest, the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy, making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van. Revelation: Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop. He refused to elaborate on the details of the new information . Police Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to elaborate on the new information. He said the contents of the report, which was completed and handed to the State Attorney at 8.50am Thursday, will remain confidential as they continue to investigate. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested. The report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver, who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators, according to ABC. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton. As the police department, Mayor's office, and state prosecutors refuse to address the development, it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of Gray's arrest more than two weeks ago. A relative of one of the suspended police officers told CNN she believes Gray was injured during his arrest outside the van. Her family member, she said, was based inside the van, and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he 'didn't do'. However, this theory is at odds with the medical examiner's report which allegedly found Gray sustained injuries by falling over inside the van, where he had been placed without a seat belt. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN her family member was in the van with Gray as he screamed and cried for medical help. But she believes the spinal injury which led to Gray's death was inflicted earlier, during his arrest on April 12. In an appeal that echoes Gray's family, she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow. 'Six officers did not injure this man,' she told Don Lemon. Secret stop: This is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stop . These are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stop . Jung Hwang's convenience store's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting Freddie Gray . 'Six officers didn't put him in the hospital. 'I'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did, that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.' Her words came after a police document was leaked to the Washington Post, in which the other prisoner in the transport van with Gray said he could hear the 25-year-old slamming himself against the wall. The prisoner speculated that Gray was trying to hurt himself. In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'. However, he admits he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton . The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family. 'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we've seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' Outrage over the unexplained death of a black man in Baltimore, Maryland prompted nationwide protests against police brutality on Wednesday from Houston to Boston. Baltimore has been the scene of near-nightly protests ever since the April 19 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who is believed to have been fatally injured while in police custody. State Attorney Marilyn Mosby urged the public to be patient as she reviews the information. 'While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,' Mosby said on Thursday. 'We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.' Freddie Gray: The 25-year-old was poisoned by lead paint as a child growing up in Baltimore . Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west side . Nicknamed 'Pepper', he was described by an ex-girlfriend as happy-go-lucky with an infectious sense of humor. The Baltimore police knew him, however, as a 5ft-8ins felon who had notched up at least 18 arrests and a handful of convictions - mainly for Class A drugs but also burglary, assault and illegal gambling. He was said to have set off running at the sight of police patrolling a well known open-air drug market. He was taken into custody for possession of a switchblade and during transport to the station he experienced what officers described as 'a medical emergency'. Gray, who had asthma, requested an inhaler and had trouble breathing in the van, but police didn't provide his inhaler. According to Gray's family his spine was severed 80 per cent at his neck, three vertebrae were fractured and his larynx was injured. Court papers describe Gray's childhood as problematic. He lived with his heroin-addicted disabled mother in a home in Sandtown-Winchester that contained enough poisonous lead in the peeling painted walls and windowsills for a court settlement to conclude that he and his two sisters were incapable of leading normal functioning lives. Lab tests conducted in the 1990s showed that they had levels of lead in their blood nearly double what the state of Maryland defines as the minimum for lead poisoning. In Baltimore, more than 2,600 children have been found to have high levels of lead in their blood, according an annual report released by the Maryland Department of the Environment in 2014. 'This is the toxic legacy of lead-based paint,” Ruth Ann Norton, head of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative and a founding member of the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission, told the Baltimore Sun. 'Our kids are ill equipped to stay in the classroom, finish school. They’re very unlikely to go on to higher education. They’re less likely to be able to hold a job', she said. 'They’re less equipped to be able to overcome the poverty and other circumstances that pull them down. Children with lead poisoning will have defects, regardless of whether their parents are ‘nice’ or not.' Gray lived off the resulting 'lead check' settlement although it is unclear exactly how much he received. Whatever money he did have he was said to spend buying designer accessories. The Sandtown neighborhood is a 72-block neighborhood made up of almost entirely of African Americans. More than one-third of residents live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter are unemployed. The majority of Maryland's state prison population are said to said to hail from Sandtown, according to the Justice Policy Institute.

A man was arrested in Quebec on Monday after he was filmed allegedly threatening a mother, her husband, and their two children with a chainsaw in a fit of road rage. Manuel Delisle, the man accused of the road rage incident involving a chainsaw, has pleaded not guilty to armed assault on Tuesday. Karine Cyr recorded the confrontation on Sunday as she was vacationing with her husband Alexandre Hermenier and their two children. Scroll down for video . Terrifying moment: Manuel Delisle (pictured) allegedly threatened a family with a chainsaw in a fit of road rage after the family attempted to follow him to record his license plate because he cut them off . After the video was posted at 7pm on Sunday night to Facebook it has been shared over 30,000 times and has over 1 million views. Delisle was arrested on Monday following the release of the viral video. Children can be heard screaming and crying in the background of the chilling footage. 'In the heat of the moment, I kept filming.... As a mother, I got very angry. I said, "Before threatening my children, come and see me,"' Cyr told CBC Montreal. The man eventually went back to his car, says Cyr, after noticing that he was being filmed and that Cyr was calling police. 'I think the man noticed that, first of all, I caught it all on video, and he could see on my face that I was terrorized and he saw me call the police,' said Cyr. Scared family: Karine Cyr (center) recorded the confrontation on Sunday as she was vacationing with her husband Alexandre Hermenier (left) and their two children . Cyr said that when the incident occured, her husband Hermenier was driving the car and that her two children were in the back seat. Cyr said that Delisle was driving recklessly and cut them off so her husband Hermenier followed the driver to record his license plate number. The two cars ended up in a dead end road and that's when Hermenier parked his car so that the other car could not leave. Hermenier said that's when Delisle allegedly threatened them with a loud piece of machinery. 'It was a terrifying situation,' Hermenier said. Cyr says that in the future if she sees a driver being reckless, she will not follow him, especially if she is with her children. 'Everyone will react differently, but I would like to say that if you see dangerous driving, do not follow the driver — the mistake that we made with two children in the back seat. We regret it tremendously. If it happens to you, pull over and just call police.' Delisle is scheduled to return to court July 7. He was released for the time being and ordered to stay away from the couple’s home and workplace and told not to communicate with them. Conditional release: Delisle released for the time being and ordered to stay away from the couple’s home and workplace and not communicate with them until he returns to court on July 7 .

Screeching around the track in a car he last drove more than 50 years ago, Sir Stirling Moss appears to have lost none of his racing pedigree. And at 85, the man widely seen as history's greatest all-round racer has revealed the unusual daily routine he thanks for his impressive longevity – 77 press-ups and half a bottle of Chardonnay. Sir Stirling, who won 212 races in his 14-year career, also spoke about how he has swapped the high-octane vehicles of his heyday for a tiny electric car that has a top speed of just 50mph. Reunited: Sir Stirling Moss sitting behind the wheel of the refurbished Austin-Healey Sprite . Success: The 85-year-old won 212 races during his 14-year career before a crash at Goodwood in 1962 . Back in action: Sir Stirling examines the refurbished car alongside Car SOS presenter Fuzz Townshend . Speaking to The Daily Mail, Sir Stirling said he sees fitness as a 'way of life' which is why he is still so confident behind the wheel. However, never one for strenuous gym sessions, he puts his health down to more unusual methods. He said: 'I have half a bottle of wine a day, which fits in very nicely, and that's it. I do what I call lady press ups and I do 77 a day. 'It's not as difficult as it sounds because I do them from a kneeling position. I could not do 70 press ups like I could when I was 30 years old. 'I've broken various bones during my career so I'm not that flexible. I think staying fit is a way of life more than anything else really.' When it comes to diet, he said he believes in indulgence and never denies himself something he wants. He said: 'I never go to bed hungry, let's put it that way, especially as Susie is such a fantastic cook. Car SOS sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. Above, Sir Stirling with presenters Fuzz Townshend and Tim Shaw . Sir Stirling drove the refurbished car in 1962 - one month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career (pictured above). He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks . 'I allow myself whatever I want but I would have to say my indulgences are that Susie and I drink one bottle of wine each day, white certainly, Chardonnay. And chocolate. I'm trying to cut that down but not that successfully.' He made the revelations after a new documentary reunited the father-of-two with the Austin-Healey Sprite he used as a training car before the 1962 Sebring three-hour race. The race took place a month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career. He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks. He returned to the cockpit a year later but decided against competing professionally as he felt he was no longer driving instinctively. The Austin-Healey Sprite was also used by the rest of his team, including Hollywood star Steve McQueen and racing legends Innes Ireland and Pedro Rodriguez. Car SOS, which broadcasts on the National Geographic Channel on Thursday, sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. While he found fame hurtling around corners at death-defying speeds, Sir Stirling now takes a more measured approach to the road. For the last 18 months he has been driving a Renault Twizy, an electric car with a top speed of 50mph. He said of the car, which retails for less than £7,000: 'I live right in the middle of London, right by Hyde Park Corner, and the limitations on an electric car like that, you don't notice them. 'If I lived outside the North Circular there might be times when I'd think "Crickey, I wonder if I'll make it back on the charge" but having said that, the Twizy is just the sort of car to have around London. Sir Stirling has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. Above, the couple at Silverstone in July 2011 . 'It is absolutely very different to the cars I used to drive. There are certainly good reasons to have a petrol car but living where I do, in the centre of London, I can't think of anything better than what I have got.' Sir Stirling, who was knighted in 2000, said he would not want to be a professional driver today because he thinks there are too few races. He said: 'It's quite different now though, they only do 18 races a year, I was doing 52 because I would go down to Australasia in the winter or Malaysia or South Africa and do all types of racing. ' It's so different now that you can't compare the life of a driver then and now. It's unfortunately one of those things that has moved on and I don't think will ever be able to move back.' He has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. He added: 'If your wife is your best friend that's the important thing to me. If every decision you think about or make or take you discuss with her first, I think that's very important. 'But then Susie says I do what I want anyway.' Car S.O.S. broadcasts on Thursday April 9 at 8pm on National Geographic Channel.

The police officer accused of murdering Walter Scott will be banned from seeing his first-born child for several months, it was revealed today. Patrol officer Michael Slager will be refused the right to hold the baby which his wife Jamie is set to give birth to in a few weeks. He is only granted video access to his eight and a half month's pregnant wife and an officer stands outside the booth whenever he talks to his family. They are not allowed to spend any time together and contact is via video screens with headphones at the Charleston County jail. But the baby will not be able to enter the South Carolina prison. Before the fall: Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, with his wife Jamie before his arrest. Slager was charged with murder after shooting Walter Scott, 50, after stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina . Visit: Michael Slager received a visit at Charleston County Jail last Friday from his pregnant wife and mom . It is deemed unsafe for an infant to enter the prison so Slager will have to rely on photographs as cell phones and access to the internet is forbidden. He will be informed by a telephone call and have to wait to see photographs, which will be examined by officials before being presented to him. When Jamie attended the jail on Friday, she was made to turn through the prison's reception area and take a seat next to a video screen for a talk with him which lasted around two hours. The booths are protected by screens to prevent onlookers from seeing inmates, but appointments have to made in advance. Relatives of other prisoners queued to use the video booths after registering with prison officials behind thick glass security screens as Jamie and her accused husband talked with the aid of headphones. But their first child together will not be allowed to visit him in prison until jail chiefs decide that the baby's health would not be at risk from being there. Although there is no specific age limit, prison policy is not to allow babies in. No date has yet been set for his first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away. Major Eric Watson of the Charleston County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online: 'He is treated just like any other prisoner, except for being in protective custody. 'His baby won't be coming to the prison and he will not be allowed to see the child. It could be several months before he does. 'His attorney can apply for the baby to be brought to the jail if he wants.' Walter Scott was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen. Family tell says the light was an accessory and both mandatory stop lamps were functioning . Slager, 33, already has two step children from his wife's previous marriage, but the new baby will be the first for him and Jamie. Major Watson said Slager had no access to the internet and was under close scrutiny to deter any threat from angry prisoners over the shooting of Walter,who was gunned down by the officer after being stopped for an apparent faulty tail light on his Mercedes. Walter's supporters and family say he was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen and this was wrong because the light was an accessory and both his obligatory stop lamps were functioning. Major Watson said Slager was being offered three meals a day and recreation time, but was isolated from other inmates. Housed in a room with one small window, he has no interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail. One released prisoner said outside the gates: 'Man, it ain't no holiday being in there. He has to watch his back more than most because of what he did. There's a lot of angry men in there, black and white.' Walter's brother Anthony said police faced 'many questions' about traffic stops based on racial profiling and that his brother's death should serve as a catalyst for a change in police policies. Meanwhile, the man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton. No date has yet been set for Slager's first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away . The mystery man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton . The 30-year-old was detained by police as Walter fled his Mercedes Benz before dying in a hail of bullets and later released. Pierre's family said they had no idea why he was in the car and how he came to be friends with the shooting victim. His grand mother Eunice Fulton, 70, said: 'I spoke with my daughter Franetta on Thursday and Pierre had only just told her he was in the car. 'It was a terrible incident but we haven't had the chance to speak to him about it. He used to live with me until a couple of years ago. But I don't where he hangs out now. He moves around.' Pierre, who was known to police, had stayed in the background since Walter was shot by officer Michael Slager and at the weekend rejected media requests for interviews. He has given a full statement to investigators, but police refused to reveal his name and what he has told them. He had requested privacy. Pierre was caught on the policeman's dash cam after Walter had fled and been shot. But police released him without charge and he was not suspected of any crime. He has convictions for unlawfully carrying a pistol and served 174 days in prison in 2005 and has been arrested several times. His grandmother added: 'He is a good grandson. He cares for his family. But I don't know what he is doing now.' Pierre has worked as a cleaner, laundry man and warehouseman over the years, but some members of his family have lost touch with him. Rosanne Grant of Alternative Staffing employment agency told Daily Mail Online: ' He worked at various jobs over the period of a year through me. The last time I hear about him was in 2006 and nothing since. I don't know what he has been working at.'

The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was ‘no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident’. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had ‘existed for some time prior to the accident’. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell’s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.’

Sunderland are trailing former Wigan striker Franco di Santo. The Argentine is playing for Werder Bremen and has scored 13 goals in 22 games this season. The Bundesliga side want £8million for the 26-year-old who Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton knows well from his time at Chelsea. Sunderland are considering a summer move for in-form Werder Bremen forward Franco Di Santo . The Argentine has been in superb form for his club this season, netting 13 goals in 22 games . Di Santo began his senior career with Chilean side Audax Italiano in 2006, before catching the Blues' eye two years later. However, he failed to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and following a similarly ineffectual loan spell at Blackburn Rovers, was sold to Wigan in 2010. He spent three seasons with the Lancashire-based outfit, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances. Di Santo was an unused substitute during the club's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2013, before being released at the end of that season. He made the move to the Bundesliga in August 2013 and has appeared to fulfil some of his early promise. Di Santo previously played for Chelsea but struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and was sold . Di Santo played for Wigan for three seasons, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances before being released .

(CNN)Roseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: "My vision is closing in now," she said. "I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up." Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making . Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) "It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of," explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. "Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision," Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy . Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk . Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . Eat your greens . Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries . Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke . While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.

Around 549 Aussies are registered as travelling in the Himalayan region. The family of 20-year-old Perth volunteer Ballantyne Forder led a tireless campaign, making headlines as they pleaded for help to find Ms Forder, who had been working in an orphanage in Kathmandu.

Eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements, a study has claimed. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.

Jessica Silva has spoken about why she had to kill her abusive husband and revealed she hopes his family can one day forgive her for what she did. In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' On Sunday night, Jessica Silva speaks publicly for the first time about the day, Mother’s Day 2012, when she stabbed and killed her partner, the father of her young son. Last month she walked free from court, despite being convicted of manslaughter, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all. Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica’s parents). He revealed to Michael Usher that the ordeal had so destroyed Jessica that 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I didn't recognise her' Jessica Silva admits she was living in fear and violence and she told no one. 'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' 'During the interview she gets to the point where she reveals "my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness". 'I don't know if there will ever be a neat ending. 'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, "you're fat, you're ugly", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . 'On that fateful night, Jessica made a split-second decision to save herself and her family,' according to the 60 Minutes program. 'Jessica opens up about her life with Polkinghorne and recounts what happened the night that ended in his death.' 'I didn't realise that she was going to be as raw as she still was,' Usher added. 'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how "I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.' See the full story on 60 Minutes at 8.30pm on Nine tonight .

(CNN)A 32-year-old Massachusetts man is facing murder charges, authorities said Wednesday, four days after another man's remains were found in a duffel bag. The Middlesex District Attorney's Office said that Carlos Colina, 32, will be arraigned the morning of April 14 for murder in connection with the remains discovered Saturday in Cambridge. Earlier this week, Colina was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. A Middlesex County judge then revoked bail for Colina in another case he's involved in, for alleged assault and battery. The victim in that case is different from the one whose remains were found in recent days. Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. "This was a gruesome discovery," District Attorney Marian Ryan said. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.

Fired: Major General James Post III was fired on Friday after making a treason comment . An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane. A-10 retirement: The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the A-10,  low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support . The inspector general's investigation interviewed several witnesses who remembered Post using the word 'treason' to describe efforts to oppose the Air Force leadership's decision to retire the plane, either via a social media campaign or by talking to Congress. In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.' General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander. Post issued an apology on Friday and said he did not intend to try to prevent people from talking to lawmakers. Handed in a latter: General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander .

Ukip candidate Kim Rose (pictured handing out sausage rolls today) is being investigated by police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls . A Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event, which also saw veteran snooker player White play pool with local youngsters. Mr Rose, a jeweller, said he was oblivious until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. Laughing off the allegations, he said: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes. 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties. 'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 'He said, "it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.' Mr Rose, who will now have to report to a police station on Monday, added: 'It was a fantastic day. We laid on teas, coffees, sandwiches and some sausage rolls. 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.' Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right) branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll' Today Mr Rose was seen out in Southampton handing out sausage rolls to members of the public . He said: 'The Ukip support is very strong here and I feel the main political parties will do anything they can to scrutinise everything about us.' Mr Rose added that if other politicians fear voters could be 'bribed with sausage rolls', perhaps it is not surprising they will not trust the country with a referendum on EU membership. Today the parliamentary candidate was out campaigning on the streets of Southampton, handing out sausage rolls to members of the public. Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, backing Mr Rose. He said: 'I think it’s utter nonsense. There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions. 'Having a few sausage rolls I don’t really think counts as one of those.' Mr Rose said the event, which was attended by 250 people, took place at a community centre in Southampton on February 21 - more than a month before Parliament was officially dissolved. He invited veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, who he described as a long-time friend. The former world number two and six-time World Champion, nicknamed 'The Whirlwind', played pool with residents, who were charged £2 to attend the event. 'I've known Jimmy as a friend for a number of years and so I asked him to come down and play pool with the kids,' Mr Rose said. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. 'I didn't want to make the event very Ukip so we put all the party banners away and everybody had a game of pool with Jimmy.' The Electoral Commission said the pastry provision was a police matter. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We have a received an allegation of "treating" by a prospective parliamentary candidate, contrary to the Representation of the People Act 1983. We are looking into the complaint. No arrests have been made.' Electoral Commission rules on treating state: 'A person is guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting. 'Treating requires a corrupt intent - it does not apply to ordinary hospitality.' Anyone found guilty of treating can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. Mr Rose has been a member of Ukip since 1999. He briefly stood as an independent in the key marginal Southampton Itchen seat in 2010 before pulling out. He is campaigning on tackling deprivation in Southampton, as well as wanting to pull the UK out of the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron came under criticism in the constituency earlier this week after sending a letter to residents spelling the constituency's name wrong three times. His letter, which has his letterhead and signature, had 'Itchen' spelled as 'Itchin', prompting the Conservatives to apologise for the embarrassing mistake. The constituency's MP has been Labour's John Denham since 1992. He held the seat in 2010 by just 192 votes and is standing down after May 7.

Nina has tried to commit suicide. She is a victim of some people that want to do bad by her.' However, Ms Moric told her fans that she was well and had no intention to end her own life. She wrote: 'What has been written is reported by newspapers and websites is not entirely correct. She said her boyfriend was in Naples at the time of the accident.

Ms Moric, pictured, reassured her many fans she only needed some time to recover from her fall . She was once married to famous paparazzi snapper Fabrizio Corona, 41, who ended up in jail and the pair have a son together, Carlos Maria, who was born in 2002. Corona, the 'king' of Italy's paparazzi, was jailed for blackmailing celebs with compromising photographs. Corona's scoops helped fuel the celebrity TV culture driven by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's channels and publications. He claimed he never blackmailed celebrities he snapped, merely offering them first option to buy the photos at the rate he would have sold them to publications. But police tapping his phone during an investigation heard him tell his then wife Nina: 'Yes, it's true, I ruin lives, I am a piece of s*** and I don't even feel guilty any more.'

A husband was left so traumatised by his wife's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock, despite his wife already being given a hefty payout. In a case which could have huge financial consequences for the NHS, Julie Ronayne was awarded £160,000 after she was left 'looking like Michelin man' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008. Her husband Edward, who lives with Mrs Ronayne in Netherley, Liverpool, was awarded £9,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife's appearance. Edward Ronayne was given £9,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up 'like Michelin man' after botched surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital (pictured) The severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis, which the woman had contracted during the surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation. The test case, being heard at London's Appeal Court, could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an NHS mishap. Mr Ronayne was awarded the damages from Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust in July 2013. Liverpool County Court heard how he had been a 'secondary victim' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife's new appearance. He had described her 'colloquially as looking like a Michelin man', the court heard. Mr Ronayne also described his wife's first two days in hospital as 'the worst days of my entire life'. He said he had been 'brought up not to complain' but had never fully recovered from the sight. He added that he had been left feeling tearful, overwhelmed, angry and powerless. The judge, who described him as 'an honest and reliable witness', said: 'His symptoms...were pathological and went beyond simply the distress and anger that a man would suffer due to the near terminal illness of his wife.' But in the appeal court today, Charles Cory-Wright QC, who represents the health trust, told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury. He said Mr Ronayne's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims, costing the cash-strapped NHS millions in compensation. The barrister argued that Mr Ronayne would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation. He added that he was visiting his wife in hospital and therefore would have expected her to look unwell. He told the court: 'Hospitals on a day-to-day basis deal with people who are ill or vulnerable. They go there followed by their loved ones. It is unfortunately a matter of day-to-day occurrence that great emotional responses will take place in a hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if Mr Ronayne is allowed to keep the money. The test case is being heard at the appeal court . 'The question arises more and more often in cases like this as to whether those relatives have a claim.' Stressing the importance of the appeal, he told the judges: 'This appeal is not just about this case, but the concerns NHS Trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place. Peritonitis is caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the stomach. It is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, which can rapidly spread around the body. Peritonitis requires immediate treatment and is a medical emergency. Most cases of peritonitis are the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix or digestive disorders. Peritonitis can be fatal and needs to be treated quickly to avoid such complications. Source: NHS . 'The effect of this judgement, if it stands, is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases, as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock. 'Often emotional illness follows, but there is not the necessary element of shock. There needs to be a suddenly shocking event which, because of its shocking nature, causes that psychiatric illness. That is often lost in the wash in these cases.' But Lord Justice Sullivan said the incident had no doubt been 'shocking' 'Simply going into hospital and seeing one's loved ones and family looking peaky is not enough,' he said. 'But to see one's wife looking like the Michelin man is shocking.' Mr Cory-Wright then replied: 'If you saw your loved one looking like the Michelin man, swollen and all that, it would be shocking in an ordinary sense. 'But it would not be shocking in the sense of being suddenly overwhelmed so as to lead to psychiatric injury.' The judges recognised the importance of the case by reserving their decision on the trust's appeal until a later date. The case was heard in front of Lord Justice Sullivan, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Beatson. Mrs Ronayne went on to make a good recovery.

John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United with thousands of supporters planning to boycott Sunday's home match against Spurs. The 50-year-old has found himself the target of angry fans who are disillusioned with Mike Ashley’s running of the club. Results on the pitch – they have lost five on the spin - have not helped Carver’s cause, but the problems at Newcastle run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad. John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United . United’s supporters will protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from billionaire Ashley, especially as the Magpies have returned record profits of £18.7million and this week revealed they also have £34m sat in a bank account. Carver is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer – or deflect – questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis, distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul. But as reported by Sportsmail last month, senior sources within St James’ Park have indicated that Derby boss Steve McClaren will take over in the summer, regardless of whether or not the Rams are promoted from the Championship. On Tyneside, however, he will inherit what Carver believes is the toughest task in the land: ‘I think it is the hardest job in football, definitely,’ he said. Steve McClaren has already been tipped as a replacement for Carver should he face the Newcastle axe . ‘For me, this is the dream job, but you love it and hate it at the same time. ‘The hardest thing is taking the criticism off your own people. Some of it is deserved and some of it is not. ‘Sometimes you’re dealt the hand and you’ve got to get on with it and this is the hand I’ve been dealt. ‘When I took it on, if I hadn’t accepted then I would have been kicking myself. ‘And I’ve said this before, I genuinely believe that if I’ve got the right tools I can do the job. ‘But it is bitter sweet at the moment. This job is definitely a rollercoaster.’ Website AshleyOut.com are co-ordinating Sunday's planned boycott. They will protest outside of the Gallowgate End before kick-off and after the game. During the match they will go to Leazes Park behind the stadium. Carver, though, has urged fans to get behind the team. Fans are unhappy at how Newcastle are being run under Mike Ashley and have planned a boycott . ‘I would go to the match because I support the team,’ said Carver when asked if he would stay away as a supporter. ‘I think they (boycotters) do support the team but they have obviously got their own issues. I respect those issues. ‘I never thought I'd see this to be perfectly honest, especially in the North East of England because we love football. ‘So obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come, and I respect that.’ Carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against Tottenham Hotspur .

This is the moment when a not-so-little baby elephant seal emerged from the sea to give a surprised tourist one big cuddle. Charlene Fritz, 35, was visiting  Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula as part of an expedition when she made an unusual friend on the beach. Despite being no more than two months old, the elephant seal pup is still thought to have weighed around 200lbs, and Ms Fritz had a struggle sitting upright. Scroll down for video . One big cuddle: The elephant seal is thought to have been no more than two months old, but at a whopping 200lbs, Canadian tourist Charlene Fritz still struggled to reciprocate the hug . Making friends: Ms Fritz had the surprise of a lifetime when the baby elephant seal came out of the water for a cuddle during an expedition to Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula . Will you be my mummy? Elephant seal pups are abandoned by their mothers at just one month to learn how to take care of themselves . Charlene, from Saskatchewan, Canada, said: 'The seal climbed on top of me without hesitation. We shared a very sweet moment in time I will never forget. 'Her mouth was all pink inside and her eyes were amazing to look into. Like the deepest depths of the sea. I could have stared into her eyes forever.' She added: 'It was made very clear to me that I was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her. 'She came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up. I wanted to hug her so badly. 'Physically she felt like a big dough ball, super warm and like she had no bones. She did not smell of fish or have bad breath. She had never even eaten a fish at that point in her life. Rules: Ms Fritz explains that she badly wanted to hug the baby seal, but that regulations on the Antarctic expedition dictated that she in no way touch the pup . 'Sweet moment in time': Ms Fritz described the seal pup's eyes as being 'like the deepest depths of the sea' Crushing: Ms Fritz struggles to sit upright under the weight of the 200lbs baby elephant seal . Two young elephant selas have a rest on the shore of Snow Hill Island, Antarctic Peninsula . Charlene, whose 2011 encounter with the seal was filmed by a friend, had at first wondered why the seal was so friendly but later learned about the harsh weaning process. She said: 'Basically the mother fattens them up with her milk for a month or so, then abandons them on the beach. 'They have never been in the ocean to learn to fish or anything and basically lay there starving until they figure out to take the leap of faith and go into the sea. 'This is why they can be so sweet and looking for love, I guess.' However, an encounter with a full-grown elephant would have been a different prospect. Males of the species can weigh up to two tonnes and are known to have a nasty temper during mating season as the battle to control harems of females.

(CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are "conscientious objectors," and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new "no jab, no pay" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. "The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments," said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. "It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing," Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.

Many people might think that trust issues, long distances and cheating scandals are the biggest strains on a relationship. But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.

James Bond would have lasted just seven minutes into his last movie Skyfall before succumbing to fatal wounds from a uranium shot if the secret agent played by Daniel Craig was real. A group of medical experts watched the 23rd outing for Ian Fleming's hero and concluded that Bond would have been unlikely to survive to the end of the two hour film, and would have died or been critically injured several times . Within the first seven minutes, Bond is hit by a depleted uranium shell - an armour-piercing round normally used to destroy tanks that would almost certainly have killed the hero. Scroll down for video . James Bond would have died minutes into Skyfall - after being hit by a depleted uranium shell and then falling from a speeding train, where he could easily have severed his spine . As Bond fights in an icy loch he would have been likely to have died from the cold or lack of oxygen . In a feature for Total Film, the medical experts examine several different action movies to see whether the man characters would have survived their ordeal. Other movies to undergo the medical assessment were Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis. Unsurprisingly John McClane would not have survived. According to the experts, Bond's depleted uranium wound would have been fatal as it 'would have turned his lungs inside out and killed him'. In the unlikely event the massive round did not cause catastrophic injuries, the radioactive nature of the ammunition 'would greatly increase his cancer risk'. Bond cheats death throughout the two hour film, including when he is locked in a gunfight on the streets of Istanbul as he attempts to chase villain Patrice for a hard drive containing details of undercover agents . The hero effortlessly performs surgery on himself, but would have been likely to have lost too much blood . Not that growing old gracefully was ever likely for James Bond, who at one stage performs surgery on himself to remove a bullet, where he 'risks blood loss, lack of consciousness, nerve and muscle damage'. He also faces a significant risk of infection. Even jumping from the roof of a speeding train into a river presents its own risks, which probably should not be tried by ordinary members of the public as he would likely 'sever his spinal cord or break his neck'. 7 mins - Bond is shot in the chest by a depleted uranium bullet, likely to kill. If he had survived this the radioactive qualities of the ammunition would have increased his risk of cancer. 12 mins - The action hero is shot and then jumps from the roof of a speeding train into a river. The height of this fall would be likely to break his neck. 31 mins - After being shot Bond bravely removes a bullet from his shoulder. This DIY surgery would have led to significant blood loss as well as damaged his nerves and muscles. 2hrs - Bond fights in an icy loch. While the temperature alone would have presented problems, fighting underwater would have significantly depleted Bond's oxygen supply and could have caused him to drown. While James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 has survived since 1960, it is unlikely the man himself would have . However, filming the movie can prove slightly dangerous as Daniel Craig has recently required knee surgery after hurting himself while performing a stunt in his final Bond movie Spectre. Even Home Alone would have produced three fatalities. Marv and Harry would have likely died within hours of the movie's end while Kevin would have been killed within the first third of the film after falling from some shelves. However, Tom Hanks in Cast Away could have plausibly survived on a desert island for four years - as long as he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash. Although according to the experts, 76 per cent of the time he would have died in the accident. While Bruce WIllis' character in Die Hard, John McClane, pictured, would not have made it to the fourth movie . Tom Hanks in Castaway could have survived on the island - in the unlikely event he escaped the aircraft .

Need to have a difficult conversation with your other half or your boss? It might be a good idea to take them out to dinner. We get on better with each other over a meal, according to researchers who said it makes everyone from work colleagues to children seem more pleasant. Dutch and Canadian scientists asked nearly 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent at least five minutes talking to someone else. Well digested: Scientists have found people felt happier and more relaxed while eating at home or at work . About a fifth of the 1,000 meetings recorded took place over a meal, the journal Physiology and Behavior reports. On these occasions participants felt happier and more relaxed, whether at home, at work or elsewhere. They felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments and were more likely to make compromises. They also believed that the person they were with was warmer and more likeable. And hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. One possible explanation is that chewing raises levels of the ‘feel-good’ brain chemical serotonin. Food for thought: The study found that people can talk about tricky subjects far easier over a meal . It is also possible that shared meals enhance our inbuilt desire to be accepted and to please others. Marije aan het Rot, of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, said that tricky topics might be best tackled over a meal. Bosses and employees and also parents and children, might all find it easier to get on at the table while dinner may not be the best idea for a first date. Dr Rot said the people in her study knew each other and the effect of a sharing a meal might be different among strangers. Apart from anything else, meals can be lengthy and people meeting for the first time might struggle to come up with enough conversation.

Have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door, been woken by a Facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger? To deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies, one company has designed a range of prototype products. You can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product, funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Scroll down for video . Leeds-based Direct Line is running a competition called #EverydayFix. They asked groups to design products to deal with common problems. These include forgetting to lock the door, which one company hopes to solve with their Forget Me Lock prototype, shown . The products were designed as part of the Direct Line Everyday Fix design makeathon. They asked people to pick their top ten ‘everyday emergencies’ - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives. Groups from London-based design company Makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist. 1. Not being able to sleep (46 per cent*) 2. Losing your keys (37 per cent) 3. Being stuck in traffic when already late (35 per cent) 4. Losing an important paper or document (33 per cent) 5. Nowhere to park (32 per cent) 6. Printer not working when you need to print something (31 per cent) 7. Running out of battery on your phone whilst out (31 per cent) 8. Discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo (30 per cent) 9. Dealing with machine operated customer service (26 per cent) 10. Forgetting your bank card when paying for an item (25 per cent) *How many people thought this was a problem . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called ‘Snooze’, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep. To deal with not remembering if you had locked your door, ONN Studio created the Forget Me Lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door. It fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. This means that even when out or about, you can find out if your door is locked or not. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost. Direct Line is running a competition on Twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about Snooze, Forget Me Lock or Nipper. The Forget Me Lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key. When the key is turned in a lock it swivels green  to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost . The Nipper device (shown) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called Snooze, shown, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep . Whichever tweet has the most retweets, with the #EverydayFix hashtag, by 23 April will go into a Kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development. ‘We’ve seen the great British designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies,’ said Paul Smyth, co-founder of Makerversity. ‘Through the Direct Line Everyday Fix event, we’ve been able to extend our role as "fixers" and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation’s everyday emergencies,’ added John Shaw, head of R&D and Innovation at Direct Line. Of the products that didn’t make the cut, one was a helmet with ‘bone conduction headphones’ that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you. Another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space, which would then alert you when the space was free, if you couldn’t find somewhere to park. And as another solution to your phone running out of battery, one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies. Products that didn't make the final shortlist included the Parking Pin, shown. You could leave this in a parking space, and it will alert you when the space is free, so you can park your car . The Relay app, shown, would let you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies . And the 'Hat Nav' was a smart helmet that used ‘bone conduction headphones’ to give you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .

As seen before... a flat version of the blue Milano Blahnik Hangsi pumps Carrie wore when marrying Big in Sex And The City are part of the haul . Lust-have: A pair of Chanel shoes in black suede and red leather with camellia flower decoration . 'They have been purchased from stores such as Harrods, and some were bought abroad in New York.

It looks like some of them were bought and never used. 'We've got items ranging from £300 into the thousands.

'It's such a genuine sale, it's not a sale that has been put together, the items are being sold for a reason. And it's a chance for people to get something in immaculate order. 'We're expecting in excess of 100 people on the day. We've got a reasonable-sized premises so we will cope fine with the extra, but we normally only have about 50 people at a sale.'

A cancer survivor who had to have part of his mouth removed after a tumour stopped him from swallowing has been given a new tongue made out of part of his arm. David Billing, 48, has told how he had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital, during which surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue. Medics then replaced the lost tissue with muscle from Mr Billing's arm. The only drawback is that it still has hairs on it, and he now has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved. David Billing, 48, had to have part of his tongue removed after being diagnosed with mouth cancer, so doctors made him a new one out of skin from his arm - which still has hairs on it . The dramatic story began after Mr Billing, a part-time welder, went to his GP in October 2013 after being unable to swallow. After a second doctor's appointment, he was referred to Royal Derby where specialists discovered an ulcer on the right-hand side of his tongue and confirmed it was cancer after a biopsy. He said: 'Being told I had cancer was mind-blowing and a real low point for me. I had no idea when they found this ulcer in my mouth that this was what it would be.' It was a double-blow for Mr Billing, as he had been made redundant just a week before from his job at digger manufacturer JCB. He said: 'It was all so overwhelming. My life and everything was ticking along nicely and the next thing I knew I'd lost my job and needed to have a major operation.' David had the procedure to remove the lump and rebuild his tongue on November 13, 2013. He said: 'I had to have a stomach tube fitted first and then go through the main procedure. Mr Billing was forced to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital (pictured), with surgeons sawing between two teeth and through his jaw to get to the tumour . 'They had to cut through the jawbone and get my face wide open to get to the ulcer then they had to remove some lymph nodes in my neck too, just to be safe in case the cancer had spread.' David spent nine days in hospital after his operation, returning now only for check-ups and once for the smaller procedure to reshape his tongue. He said: 'Usually, people have to go on chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the operation and, during this, the skin tissue used to rebuild the tongue shrinks in size. 'Because I didn't need either, it meant I later needed this smaller operation to have the bit of skin trimmed. 'My tongue's absolutely fine. I had to have speech therapy after the procedure but it's not had any long term impact on my speech or my eating or drinking.' David continued to use a feeding tube and relied on liquid foods until his first proper meal on Christmas Day 2013. And, in another fortunate turn of events, he was offered his old job a JCB back in March 2014. He added: 'JCB actually took me back having originally laid me off because of a lack of work. Mr Billing, who is now preparing to run the London Marathon to raise money for Cancer Research, says his speech is back to normal - though he does have to go to hospital to have his tongue shaved . 'It was the best feeling in the world when, two weeks after coming through the operation, the consultant told me the cancer was completely removed and I didn't even need radiotherapy or chemotherapy.' Now David is preparing to run the London Marathon and is hoping to raise more than £3,000 for cancer research. He said: 'I was not fit or well at all when I was watching the London Marathon last year but I thought how much I'd love to do it. 'I've never done anything like it before so, when I started feeling better, I decided to start training and now I'm about to take part in this experience of a lifetime. 'If I can get over the finish line, whatever time I do it in, it will be absolutely brilliant.'

The lovers who got the most complaints in New York City for loud sex are a handyman and the girlfriend he pops round for quickies with in the building where he works. The 25-year-old boytoy is the lover, of a Dominican woman in her late 30s, who invites him round for romps around her entire apartment in Brooklyn. The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex. Most complained: The building maintenance worker (left) and his girlfriend (right), who is now four months pregnant, were complained about six times for excessive noise at the Bay Ridge block, official records show . Say it loud: This is the apartment block with six calls made to 311 - New York city's non-emergency number - because of complaints of loud sex . Blue: The woman who was complained about was spoken to by police today. She later left, saying: 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone.' The woman whose moans during sex sparked the highest number of complaints in New York said today: 'I'm not hurting anyone'. The woman, who declined to give her name, walked out of the apartment block wearing striped maxi dres, a white jacket and sunglasses. She looked upset and said she was hurt by all the attention - and revealed she was pregnant. She said: 'I'm four months pregnant. 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'. On the job: The building handyman complained about over noisy sex was at work today - at the apartment block where his girlfriend lives. House of noise: The apartment building is in Bay Ridge, close to New York harbor in Brooklyn . No idea: The building's owner Madelene Behefte told Daily Mail Online she had no idea about the complaints . No respite: The front door of the apartment at the center of six complaints for noisy sex. It failed to stop neighbors from overhearing the couple's antics . DNAInfo reported that New York's 311 helpline, for non-emergency complaints to city authorities, recorded a total of 133 complaints about loud sex between January 1 2014 and February 12 2015. Brooklyn, the borough now associated with trendy hipsters and home to would-be president Hillary Clinton's campaign, had the highest number of complaints, at 42. Brooklyn is the most populous of the city's five boroughs. Queens was next with 37, the Bronx and 31 and Manhattan had 23. Staten Island recorded none. The website reported that on November 14 last year, a 311 operator logged: 'Neighbors are having very loud sex with the windows open that can be heard throughout the whole bldg.' The complainant told the website the woman was 'moaning and screaming "Oh yeah, oh, do it to me".' It was followed by another woman shouting at the couple: 'Shut your f***ing windows you wh**e.' Complaints to 311 are passed to police to investigate if they are available, but officers found no noise disturbance when they attended the Bay Ridge block.

Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless. The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, José Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than £300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for. Pacquiao works up a sweat as he shadow boxes during preparations for his May 2 clash with Mayweather . With his eyes closed and grimacing with effort, Pacquiao ramps up his shadow boxing routine on Monday . On his toes and focused, Pacquiao is looking to defy the odds against fight favourite Floyd Mayweather . Roach kneels in the corner as Pacquiao's team prepare the eight-division champion for a session on the pads . The Filipino works his way around the ring, looking sharp after sharing a joke with Shapiro and Roach . Pacman limbers up ahead of his workout on Monday in the gym just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood . Pacquiao is going through his final preparations ahead of the bout billed as 'The Biggest Fight in History' Confident Pacquiao kicks his feet high during his warm-up ahead of training at Wild Card Boxing . There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight. Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout. 'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'

Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to quit because he was becoming increasing depressed watching cable news . Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to call time on his 17 year reign because he was becoming increasing depressed by American politics and watching cable news. Speaking for the first time since making his shock decision, Stewart said he was looking forward to not having to watch the 'relentless' 24-hour news networks anymore. 'Watching these channels all day is incredibly depressing,' Stewart told The Guardian. 'I live in a constant state of depression. I think of us as turd miners. I put on my helmet, I go and mine turds, hopefully I don't get turd lung disease.' Asked if he'd ever voluntarily watch Fox News, Stewart said, 'Let's say that it's a nuclear winter, and I have been wandering, and there appears to be a flickering light through what appears to be a radioactive cloud and I think that light might be a food source that could help my family. 'I might glance at it for a moment until I realize, that's Fox News, and then I shut it off.' Stewart also confessed that his 'moments of dissatisfaction' with the show had started to become more frequent. 'It's not like I thought [The Daily Show] wasn't working any more, or that I didn't know how to do it. It was more, "Yup, it's working. But I'm not getting the same satisfaction,'" he said. 'These things are cyclical. You have moments of dissatisfaction, and then you come out of it and it's OK. But the cycles become longer and maybe more entrenched, and that's when you realize, "OK, I'm on the back side of it now.'" Scroll down for video . Stewart said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance in 2011 . Even the upcoming 2016 Presidential election campaign couldn't reignite Stewart's passion the way it once did. 'I'd covered an election four times, and it didn't appear that there was going to be anything wildly different about this one,' said Stewart. 'Honestly, it was a combination of the limitations of my brain and a format that is geared towards following an increasingly redundant process, which is our political process. 'I was just thinking, "Are there other ways to skin this cat?' And, beyond that, it would be nice to be home when my little elves get home from school, occasionally." Stewart also said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance. The former secretary of defense appeared on The Daily Show in 2011 for an interview, which the comedian says he messed up. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, left, would be taking over . 'He just went into the general gobbledegook,' said Stewart. "Mnah mnah mnah, well, you have to remember, it was 9/11 mnah mnah." I should have pushed, but he's very adept at deflecting.' Rumsfeld, who was on the show to promote his memoir, Known And Unknown, dodged Stewart's questions about faulty U.S. intelligence leading up to the Iraq War. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, 31, would be taking over. Noah has already had to combat  accusations of anti-Semitism over a series of old tweets. Stewart has voiced his full support for his successor, recently calling the incoming host 'incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart.' The exiting host told The Guardian that one reason for  stepping down early in the presidential election cycle was to give Noah a big story to tackle. Stewart said he felt 'that, for the show, you don't want to leave when the cupboard's bare. So I think it's a better introduction when you have something providing you with assisted fuel, like a presidential campaign.'

An eight-grade girl accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in adult jail while awaiting trial, a judge. A defense petition to return 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek to the juvenile facility where she was initially sent after the body of 54-year-old Cheryl Silvonek was discovered last month was denied by Lehigh County Judge Maria Dantos on Friday. District Attorney Jim Martin had opposed the petition on behalf of the teenager, who is charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy. Her boyfriend, Caleb Barnes, 20, who is from El Paso, Texas, but was stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, is charged with homicide. JamieSilvonek, the eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, it was ruled on Friday . Cheryl Silvonek's body was found with stab wounds in a shallow grave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and her vehicle partially submerged in a pond a few miles from the family home. Jamie Silvonek was sent to the county jail this month after she was charged as an adult and is in the women's housing unit, away from older inmates, county officials said. Authorities said Barnes and the teenager met in October, when she was 13, but she told him she was 17. Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. The teen's mother found out about their relationship in early March and ordered them to end it. A day later, the teen told Barnes in a text message, 'I want her gone,' police said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. The 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. 14-year-old JamieSilvonek allegedly conspired to kill her mother Cheryl Silvonek with her 20-year-old boyfriend 'because she disapproved of their relationship' Barnes confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, and that given the age disparity 'there has to be some type of duress or coercion'. He said his client 'cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom' and she feared for her life and that of her father. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life . Police found the body of Cheryl Silvonek in a shallow grave a few miles from her home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby .

Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed for a year after orchestrating a scam to steal £15,000 of goods from the Asda in Basildon, Essex, where he worked . An Asda manager orchestrated a scam that used the supermarket's own delivery service to steal goods worth more than £15,000 - then managed to land a job at Lidl after he was sacked. Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed after running the scam where stock including alcohol, cigarettes, DVDs, computer games and consoles were taken from the store in Basildon, Essex, where he worked. Southend Crown Court heard how the conspiracy was uncovered, following a period during which Gridley and colleague Jay Reed were under suspicion. Thomas Daniel, prosecuting, told the court that goods, ranging from televisions to baby formula, were delivered to Reed's address and presumably sold on. He said: 'Two anonymous reports were received by Asda, one of which suggested Mr Gridley was involved in selling items believed to have been stolen, such as TVs and baby formula. 'When Mr Gridley was ill for a certain period of time, those deliveries stopped, and when he recovered they started again. 'Another email suggested stolen goods being delivered to the address of Mr Gridley's cousin.' But shockingly, after being sacked from the store, Gridley managed to land a managerial role at Lidl in Romford, Essex. Gridley, who was former home shopping manager of the store, was sentenced to 12 months for his leading role in a conspiracy to steal £15,852.46 worth of goods between November 2013 and April last year. The court heard that Reed and another defendant James Munyard had been pressured into taking part in the scam by Gridley, who was their superior. Stock including alcohol, cigarettes were taken from shelves and delivered to addresses using the supermarket's own home delivery service. File photo . Section leader Reed, 23, and Munyard, 21, both avoided prison, but were given suspended sentences of eight and four months, respectively. Mitchell Cohen, representing Munyard, told the court that his client, whose role was confined to taking items off shelves and putting them in a crate, had attempted to be transferred from the store in order to escape Gridley's control. James Munyard (pictured) avoided jail for his part in the scam . Reed was deemed to have been in a position of trust and responsibility in the criminal enterprise, but Recorder Gerard Pounder said he had a lesser role than Gridley, 26, and Munyard even less so. Despite hearing Gridley, of Tilbury,  financially supported his former partner and their two-year-old child but also his own father and grandparents, Recorder Pounder said he had no choice but to send him to prison. He said: 'You were in a position of supreme trust and you say you started this because of threats made regarding a drug debt of your cousin's, you continued even as those threats faded, and brought other people in, too.' Sentencing Reed to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 200 hours' unpaid work, he said: 'You were in a lesser role than Mr Gridley but you were a section leader and had responsibilities. 'In that respect you were somebody who knew the system and it was to your premises these items were taken - without that and your part in the enterprise, it would not have worked.' Munyard, who Mr Cohen said 'didn't have the spine to stand up to what he was being asked to do,' was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, and 100 hours' unpaid work. A spokesperson for Lidl told MailOnline they are unable to comment until an internal investigation has been conducted.

The 14-time major champion is bidding to win his fifth green jacket, but has been plagued by a succession of injuries and even the chipping yips in recent times. The world will find out which version of Woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48pm. Defending champion Bubba Watson, hoping to win his third Masters title in four years, will tee off at 2.24pm alongside England's former US Open champion Justin Rose and 21-year-old South Korean amateur Gunn Yang, who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the US Amateur last year. Those watching the 2.02pm group on Thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game's most colourful characters go head-to-head. Ian Poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet, but even he might meet his match in American young gun Patrick Reed, who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at Doral last year. He followed that up by shushing the home crowd during a cocksure display at Gleneagles. Three-time Masters champion Phil MIckelson, hitting from behind trees during practice, will play alongside McIlroy in the first two rounds . Ryan Moore, pictured during a practice round at Augusta, will join McIlroy and Mickelson on the course for round one and two . Woods will be accompanied with Wales' Jamie Donaldson and Jimmy Walker of the USA during the first two rounds of the competition . US Open champion Martin Kaymer is in the group behind world No 1 McIlroy, with Brandt Snedeker and Houston Open winner JB Holmes. McIlroy and Mickelson were among the players battling for the US PGA title in near-darkness at Valhalla last year, with Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light. With 98 players in the field, Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45pm (7:45am local time), with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier, the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while Arnold Palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder. England's Danny Willett will begin his Masters debut in the second group at 12:56pm alongside 1987 winner Larry Mize and US amateur public links champion Byron Meth. Woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth Masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round. The American superstar has started just two events in 2015, carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second, but said he was ready to 'compete to win a golf tournament' after 11 holes of practice on Monday. The final group tees off at 1:59pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world, Australia's Jason Day, Spain's Sergio Garcia and Fowler. Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors last year.

A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by £345 to £975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from £870 to £1,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices . The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from £870 to £1,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game . Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay £345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost £975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season . Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.

A pregnant mother with a rare form of dwarfism has revealed the physical challenges of raising her three-year-old son - who is more than half her size - while preparing for the arrival of her second child. Tiffanie DiDonato, from Swansboro, North Carolina, was born with diastrophic dysplasia and underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries as a child so she would grow to be 4'10 tall, instead of her previous height of 3'8, which is how tall her son Titan currently is. But even with the additional inches, parenting a rambunctious toddler can be difficult for the 34-year-old mom who has certain physical limitations, and often has to use crutches, or sometimes a wheelchair, in addition to being three months pregnant. 'Titan is a typical kid – he wants to do what he wants to do,' she told People of her son. 'And chasing him outside or across the street is not an option for me.' Helping hand: Tiffanie DiDonato, who has diastrophic dysplasia, a rare form of dwarfism, can be seen grocery shopping with her three-year-old son Titan, who is more than half her size, but always willing to assist her . Making it work: The 34-year-old mom from Swansboro, North Carolina, is 4'10 tall and is constantly re-teaching herself to walk because of the stiff muscles and arthritis, which are side effects of her dwarfism . Tiffanie, who married to Eric Gabrielse, a 6’1, 29-year-old Marine who is 6'0, explained that she has to get creative when it comes to dealing with her son - especially when he throws himself on the floor and cries. When tantrums occurs she will walk way and say: 'Mommy can't help when you're yelling at me... No crying and Mommy can help.' Tiffanie noted that this trick, which she has developed over time, usually prompts her son to get up and give her a hug. 'I try my best to let him know throwing tantrums doesn't get you very far - a great lesson to learn, don't you think?' she said. Great news: Tiffanie and her husband Eric Gabrielse, a 29-year-old Marine, are expecting their second child in September . All smiles: Titan happily cuddled up to his dad for this snapshot . Full of life: The three-year-old had a laugh while his dad Eric enjoyed his breakfast . Tiffanie, who co-wrote the memoir Dwarf with Rennie Dyball, has difficulty lifting Titan now that is getting taller because her arms are significantly shorter than most moms. The stiff muscles and arthritis that are side effects of her condition mean that she has to constantly re-teach herself how to walk - which makes chasing after Titan impossible. Losing control of her son is one of her greatest fears, which is why she avoids leaving the house with Titan when she doesn’t her husband Eric or another family member by her side. 'I have even watched Eric struggle to catch him outside and he's a Marine!' she explained. ‘We named Titan correctly, because he's almost too speedy and too athletic.' Because she 'wouldn't stand a chance' against outracing her son, she makes sure she stays '10 steps ahead of the game' at all times. Overcoming obstacles: Tiffanie can be seen as a child wearing braces on her legs. She underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries when she was younger . Painful choice: Tiffanie was expected to be 3'8 tall, but her surgeries allowed her to grow to 4'10, enabling her to be more independent . Tiffanie recalled times in which Titan has climbed into the dryer or wedged himself behind the couch or plopped himself inside the sink. Without physically being able to get him out on her own, she has to rely on her own quick thinking, as well as game she made up to ensure his cooperation. She explained that when she sings: 'One, two, three, help me!' and reaches out for Titan, he will take her hands and pull himself up and out of whatever precarious situation he has gotten himself into. Titan's willingness to lend his mom a helping hand is one of the reasons she is confident that he will be a fantastic big brother. 'He really is - whether he is intentionally doing so or no - becoming my little helper,' she said. 'We conquer the day-to-day challenges together, and I hope we always do.' Sweet moment: Tiffanie and Titan snuggled up together on the couch before he fell asleep . Support system: Tiffanie wore a yellow halter dress while posing for this photo with a friend . Sports fans: Eric and Tiffanie smiled for the camera at a Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium in New York City .

An Old Bailey judge has blasted his junior colleague for ‘taking his eye off the ball’ and passing an 'unlawful' sentence when letting a BT manager dodge jail for a £28,000 expenses scam. Wheelchair-bound  Christopher Starrs, 50, was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in January after admitting his part in a two-and-a-half year con against his employer BT. Starrs, along with fellow BT Openreach manager Phillip Tamplin, invented clamped cars, overtime hours and damage to home owners’ property during broadband installation, and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims. Blasted: Judge Nicholas Cooke QC (left) blasted his junior colleague Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC (right) for 'taking his eye off the ball' when he sentenced Christopher Starrs in January this year . Both Starrs and Tamplin, 53, who made £124,000 from the con, admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses. Tamplin was jailed for two years at January's sentencing hearing, but Mr Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC spared Starrs jail as an ‘act of mercy’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £1,500 fine. However, senior Judge Nicholas Cooke QC has now said the sentence was ‘unlawful’ - and added Starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes. ‘It was an unlawful sentence passed and now I need to do something to put it right, because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter,’ he said. ‘He was mercifully dealt with, sadly by a judge who didn’t have his eye on the ball.’ The judge told Mark Haslam, defending: ‘The sentence was wrong but that’s a matter of personal opinion. ‘Your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison. ‘What the Recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn’t available to him. ‘No one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on Mr Starrs was unlawful. ‘I am sorry to be the headmaster but we really don’t want this sort of thing.’ Fraud: Wheelchair-bound Starrs, 50, was a manager with BT who admitted defrauding the company of £28,000 over two years . The Recorder, who is the head of 4 Bream Buildings chambers and took the Silk in 2006, gave Starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine, and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue. But Judge Cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order. Turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing, he added: ‘This is supposed to be a centre of excellence, when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and can’t do. ‘The judge should have been told what his powers were.’ Prosecutor John Ojakovoh said Starrs offered a ‘blank cheque’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £28,000 he stole. After the judge heard the CPS will now drop the confiscation proceedings, he said the original sentence will stand, quipping: ‘He no doubt thanks his lucky stars.’ Both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time. The main fraudulent claim was for BT vehicles which had been ‘clamped’ by parking authorities. BT Openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work. The company pays out around £1million in fines in London alone every year. Starrs and Tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates. Sentencing Recorder Trimmer, who has led a string of high-profile Serious Fraud Office prosecutions in the last two years, said: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time. ‘It involved over 100 or so false claims, made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity. ‘Both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity. ‘You both knew how it could be conducted, concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally.’ Starrs, of Northolt, Middlesex, who had worked at BT since 1988, was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair. He was not at court today due to a mix-up over whether he was required to attend.

A forensic psychiatrist has testified that Lou Gehrig's disease is the reason a former sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his wife and sister-in-law, whom the defendant described in a suicide note as his threesome partners. Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.

The US body that regulates Internet addresses is looking to crack down on a Canadian company using the new '.sucks' domain name to extract exorbitant sums from celebrities such as Kevin Spacey and companies looking to protect their reputations. So far, purchased names include Youtube.sucks, Bing.sucks, Visa.sucks, Bankofamerica.sucks, Yahoo.sucks, Telusmobility.sucks and other major brand names. Kevin Spacey has reportedly paid have his his '.sucks' domain taken down. Kevin Spacey is reportedly among celebrities paying out to have their name removed from one of the  '.sucks' domains which opened on 30 March . Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains attacking her, CNBC reported. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or 'ICANN,'  sent a letter on Thursday to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Office of Consumer Affairs to see if the actions of company Vox Populi Registry Ltd. were illegal. ICANN initially approved of the so-called top-level domain name, among nearly 600 it has added recently to expand beyond common names such as '.com,' '.org' and '.us.' But it is backtracking after an advisory panel made up of industry groups and companies like Microsoft, Verizon and eBay complained last month. Vox Populi began accepting registrations using '.sucks' on March 30 from trademark holders and celebrities before it is released to public applicants. Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains . It has recommended charging $2,499 a year for the privilege, and according to Vox Populi CEO John Berard, most of the names have been sold by resellers for around $2,000 a year. Berard has said the domain name is meant to create destinations for companies to interact with their critics and called his company's business 'well within the lines of ICANN rules and the law.' Two weeks ago, the advisory body called the Intellectual Property Constituency representing major companies and industry groups asked ICANN in a letter to halt the rollout of '.sucks,' calling it a 'shakedown scheme' and 'predatory.' Companies like GoDaddy.com register some domain names for just $1 a year, and Vox Populi will offer consumers the right to secure a '.sucks' address for just $10 a year starting in September. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme.' ICANN said in its letter that if Canadian or U.S. regulators find Vox Populi's actions are illegal, it could declare the company in breach of its contract and seek to change the registry's behavior. It said it is also seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme .

The semi-final line-up for the Champions League has been confirmed and, although there may be no English involvement, four European giants are just three games from being crowned champions of the continent in Berlin on June 6. With Real Madrid and Juventus winning on Wednesday to join Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the last four, this season's competition is one of the toughest to call in recent memory. We asked our team of reporters who they think will win this season's Champions League. SAMI MOKBEL - Barcelona . Momentum is key at this point in the season and Barcelona are in overdrive. Their early-season woes are a distant memory and Luis Enrique is finally getting his point across. Lionel Messi remains phenomenal and a certain Luis Suarez is hitting top gear just at the right time. Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left) , Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) NEIL ASHTON - Bayern Munich . They overcame their blip (the rip in the seam of Pep's trousers) to power their way beyond Porto in the second leg of the quarter-final and remind everyone just how good they are. They have much to prove after last season's disappointment but they are a phenomenal team. I expect them to draw Barcelona in the semi-final. Bayern Munich produced a stunning display in the second leg to beat Porto in the quarter-finals . JOE BERNSTEIN - Barcelona . Bayern and Barcelona are both better teams than Juventus or Real Madrid and to separate them is nigh on impossible. But given the backroom strife at Bayern, particularly over Arjen Robben's injury, I'd narrowly go for Messi and Barcelona ending their four-year Champions League 'drought'. DOMINIC KING - Barcelona . To think at the start of the season, after Real Madrid pummelled them in the first Clasico, that we thought the beginning of the end had started. Now they look majestic once more and the front three of Messi, Neymar and Suarez gives them an edge over all their rivals. Hopefully it will be a straight shootout between them and Bayern Munich in Berlin. This is the best Champions League semi-final line-up ever and we might get the spectacular final to go with it. LEE CLAYTON - Juventus . Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba and Gianluigi Buffon -  experience, goals and know-how. Tevez isn't Messi (or Cristiano Ronaldo), Pogba isn't Thomas Muller and Buffon isn't Manuel Neuer: Yes, they are ugly bugs on a catwalk of super powers, but they CAN win this. After all, Denmark and Greece both won the Euros. Juventus celebrate their 1-0 aggregate victory over Monaco in the last eight of the Champions League . Juventus striker Carlos Tevez leads the scoring in Serie A this season with 18 goals . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI - Barcelona . Since it's been established that we don't live in a post-Messi (48 goals in 49 starts) world I can't bring myself to bet against him. Would love to see them in a final against Bayern Munich. CHRIS WHEELER - Bayern Munich . After that crushing 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the semi-finals a year ago, and the shock of suffering a 3-1 first-leg loss to Porto in this season’s quarters, expect the real Bayern to stand up and deliver another Champions League triumph for Guardiola. Is it written in the stars that Barcelona will be standing in his way? LAURIE WHITWELL - Barcelona . The front three of Messi, Suarez, and Neymar are beginning to click to devastating effect and the magical allure of Barcelona is returning. It would be some turnaround from the disputes and disappointments of early season, but this is a team full of players who know how to win the trophy. Neymar scored both goals in Barcelona's 2-0 second-leg victory over Paris Saint-Germain at the Nou Camp . LAURA WILLIAMSON - Real Madrid . They might be depleted by injuries but experience and pedigree count in this competition and, as we saw against Atletico Madrid, you can never count against the 10-time winners. Or, indeed, a certain Ronaldo. Javier Hernandez's 88th-minute winner saw Real Madrid edge past their local rivals Atletico Madrid . Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League title and a second in a row with Real Madrid . ROB DRAPER - Bayern Munich . Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben are on the way back, Pep  has a point to prove and the team have the memory of that awful semi-final against Real Madrid last year to drive them on. As long as they don't take their foot off the gas having already won the Bundesliga, they'll make good the disappointment of last year. Robert Lewandowski celebrates one of five first-half goals Bayern Munich scored against Porto on Tuesday . JACK GAUGHAN - Barcelona . I'm tempted to say Bayern Munich but they've got similar buckling deficiencies to the Barcelona we've seen recently. By contrast, the Catalans have found their misplaced defensive steel, have a coach whose win percentage eclipses all to precede him and - well - possess Messi. And Neymar. And Suarez. SAM CUNNINGHAM - Bayern Munich . I would back Guardiola to outwit any of the remaining managers in the tournament with the players at his disposal. Some were writing Bayern Munich off after their 3-1 first-leg defeat by Porto and look how that went. Everyone talks about Messi and Ronaldo, but the collective force of Bayern players is frightening. OLIVER TODD - Barcelona . After a difficult start to the season they've hit form at the right time. Enrique has found a way to get the front three of Messi,  Suarez and Neymar to fire and even if you can keep two of them quiet - as Paris Saint-Germain did on Tuesday - the other will make you pay.

Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.

Steve Davis would love to see Jimmy White and Reanne Evans light up the Crucible stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn. The king of the baize in the 1980s believes the Whirlwind and the doyenne of the women's tour face tall orders to get through qualifying for the Betfred World Championship. Evans saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion Ken Doherty on Thursday, in the first of three preliminary rounds, while White will tackle fellow veteran James Wattana in his opener on Saturday. Steve Davis will attempt to qualify for this year's Betfred World Championship at the Crucible . But Davis, who will also attempt to qualify, expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in Sheffield. He calls 29-year-old Dudley potter Evans 'a great player', and said of the 10-time ladies' world champion: 'It's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods. It's a bun fight, but she's perhaps the best woman player I've ever seen. 'In the 1980s I saw Allison Fisher who was the best around, and she was an excellent, excellent player but more methodical. 'Reanne is more like the Jimmy White or the Ronnie O'Sullivan of the women's game. She has the feel for the game, she's at one with the table. 'She could cause a surprise, but to win three matches is the tough bit. It's hard enough for me and Jimmy. 'If me or Jimmy qualify for the Crucible, it's arguably as big a win as we've ever had. 'I've got a little bit of a desire to do it, but Jimmy would certainly love to get back to the Crucible.' Reanne Evans takes on Ken Docherty for a place at the World Championships in Sheffield . Reanne Evans is a 10-time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010-11 season. She suffered 18 consecutive defeats however and failed to qualify the following year. White, who lost six World Championship finals, last appeared at the tournament in 2006, and has fallen short in qualifying every year since. While 52-year-old White is in the autumn of his career, for Davis these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down. He turns 58 in August and fell off the main tour 12 months ago. A memoir, Interesting, hits the bookshelves on Thursday. A tricky qualifying opener against Jamie Cope could end in disappointment, but it would be short-lived. 'I can't build up the intensity that I used to have, but I must admit I'm getting excited about pitting my wits against another generation of players,' Davis said. 'Of course, it'll all end in tears. 'I'm not totally committed but I still have the juices running through me a little bit. I've been practising but it's not a pretty sight. They're wobbling more in the pockets before saying 'nope'. 'Whether I get to the TV stages, that's a long shot. That's tough. Jimmy White will take on fellow veteran James Wattana in qualifying on Thursday . 'I was still practising hard even when I wasn't getting to the latter stages of the Crucible, and in the end you have to say, 'Yeah, I've tried, but the price is too much investment of time'. 'Now if I've lost a match, by the time I've got in the car I've thought about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day, rather than beating up the person who's come up with me. 'I think it's been a bit like Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I'm sure in the night that someone swapped me for a more mellow version.' Davis won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament, but the 1985 'black-ball final' defeat to Dennis Taylor stands over and above all memories. Dennis Taylor in action during the memorable 1985 World Championship final against Davis . The second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant Davis having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again. 'I don't remember anything as much as I remember the '85 final,' Davis said. 'I do remember the last frame, more so because I've watched it through on video a few times. 'My career was a blur and all games and matches blur into one in the end, it's only the strange moments that do stick in your brain.' Interesting by Steve Davis is published in hardback by Ebury Press on April 9, priced £20.

(CNN)Is America a nation divided?  And has Ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions? It's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation: immigration, community and police relations, poverty, education and dozens of other crucial matters facing America. Adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite, and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country. In Ohio, we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services, criminal justice, economic competiveness, infrastructure -- and I've enjoyed sharing our state's winning formula with others in my travels. In 2011, I returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in Congress in the 1980s and '90s.  Over the intervening years, Ohio had lost its way and was hurting. I felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 Ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet. Ohio is much stronger today. And that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing. For example, we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation's strongest state budgets and a nearly $2 billion surplus. We've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones. We've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in America, including tax cuts for the working poor. We're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and Ohio's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade. Getting Ohio back on track wasn't easy. It required big ideas, going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests. Yes, we have a great success story to tell about our state. And we need to make Ohio's success contagious. The leadership style that helped us turn around Ohio is needed in Washington, where America's $18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting Mother's Day if it required their action. Great leaders are not primarily guided by polls, political parties, focus groups, re-election, special interests or protecting the status quo. Instead they bring teams of people together, challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee in Congress in the 1990s, I helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. We worked in a bipartisan effort that doesn't happen enough. There were, of course, disagreements along the way, but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means. Given the polarizing issues facing our country, America needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego, selfishness and power produce. Leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets, tax cuts, welfare reform, border security, immigration and health care. We see it every day. There are certain values that guide great countries: . • Personal responsibility: It obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities. • Empathy: It allows us to walk in someone else's shoes, so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another, better way that makes all of us stronger. • Teamwork: It sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win. • Faith: It tells us we are made special in the image of God with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth. These values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all Americans instead of producing rhetoric, sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform. In Ohio we've implemented this winning strategy. It's worked there, and it will work for the nation as well.

A tortoise has been reunited with his owner after spending nearly a year on the run and even finding a new home - at the age of 109. Owner Wendy Stokes, 74, had given up hope of ever seeing Toby again after he escaped from her garden 11 months ago. But he has now returned home and after piecing together his escapades over the last year, it's become apparent he's had quite an adventure. Reunited: Wendy Stokes, 74, is delighted to have 109-year-old Toby back after his escape 11 months ago . He wandered through a gate in her garden and headed for the open road where he was picked up by a passing driver concerned for his safety and taken to a nearby animal rescue centre. Six months ago, he was re-homed with a couple living in Margate, Kent, 22 miles away from Wendy's farm in West Hougham. But the couple, who could just about make out the word 'Stokes' written in white paint on his shell, felt they needed to find out who Tony belonged to. With nothing else to go on, they decided to call every Stokes in Kent listed in the phonebook. Eventually came across a delighted Wendy, who immediately arranged to collect him. She's had Toby since the 1980s when he was given to her by her late great aunt. He was returned home last Sunday, a full 11 months after his amazing, if a little slow, adventure. Wendy has had Toby since the 1980s and wrote her surname, Stokes, on his back in white paint . Retired farm worker Wendy said: 'I had painted my name and number on the side of his shell but it had faded when he went missing so they couldn't read it. 'The people who found him could read Stokes but they couldn't make out the number. 'He had got out because I had left my gate open. It is normally closed because we have sheep in the paddock but they were in a different field. 'Toby just walked out and trotted towards the road where somebody picked him up and took him to a rescue centre. 'Everyone knows I have a tortoise and we always take him to the village fete so he is a bit of a local celebrity. 'I was devastated when he went missing and spent weeks looking for him in all the fields around the farm.' She added: 'I went all goosey when they told me they had Toby because I had really given up on him. 'It is brilliant having him back and I think everybody was keeping their eye out for him all this time.'

A vicious swan known for terrorising punters and kayakers on the River Cam is now believed to have a grandson following in his footsteps. The savage swan nicknamed Asbaby, which still has many brown baby feathers, has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the Cambridge river. Mr Asbo, the swan believed to be his grandfather, was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 by river authorities after repeatedly attacking rowers. Scroll down for video . Watch out: Savage swan Asbaby has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the river in Cambridge over the Easter weekend . Up close: One resident who lives near the river said Asbaby 'sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers' Theft: Asbaby was seen attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag (above) Capturing the moment: Asbaby (pictured) is believed to be the grandson of Mr Asbo, who was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 . Pecking at the punters: The swan on the River Cam is said to be even more vicious than his father, Asboy, and grandfather, Asbo . Asbaby was seen at the weekend attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag. He is said to have inherited his bad temper from his grandfather, and his father Asboy, who conducted a reign of terror on the river last summer. Harry Crossell, 65, who lives near the river, said: ‘He is even more vicious than his father and grandfather. '(He) sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers. I’ve seen him chasing after punts and taking their picnics. 'Once I even saw him put his beak around a bottle of champagne. ‘It’s terrifying for river users and it’s making people think twice about going out on the water.’ Another resident, Simon Patterson, 52, said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour would get worse as he gets older. ‘The swan is only young at the moment, we’re concerned he will get stronger and more vicious as he grows bigger,’ he said. Shock: The swan got up close with this woman, whose surprise at what was unfolding in front of her could clearly be seen (right) Making an appearance: The juvenile swan nicknamed Asbaby got far too close for comfort to tourists on the Cam over the Easter weekend . Naughty swan: One resident said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour on the River Cam would get worse as he gets older . ‘He swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way. We thought Mr Asbo and Asboy were bad, but this swan is even worse. ‘It’s very worrying as the river is starting to get busier now, if he continues someone could get really hurt.’ But Colin Sparkes, navigation officer for Conservators of the River Cam, told MailOnline today: ‘Most swans get a bit aggressive this time of year. ‘It's mating season - they protect their territory. As far as I’m aware, it's not causing great problems on the river. ‘Swans this time of year start to look out for their nest, and indeed when the young and born. ‘It’s a very tricky one because the more people feed the swans, the more aggressive they tend to become. Close to the camera: Asbaby 'swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way', according to one local resident . Worrying: Asbaby's actions are said to be 'terrifying for river users' and are 'making people think twice about going out on the water' Threatening: The behaviour of Mr Asbo (above) before he was moved 60 miles three years ago left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises . No longer there: The Cam Conservators moved Mr Asbo about 60 miles away in 2012. His son Asboy is seen above in this file photograph . 'They get used to swimming up to people expecting to be fed.’ He confirmed that there are no plans to remove Asbaby from the river, adding that the case of Mr Asbo was completely different. Mr Sparkes said: ‘That swan (Mr Asbo) was extremely aggressive - it's the most aggressive swan I've ever come across. ‘I believe that was probably down to the way he'd been brought up looking for food from various people.’ The Conservators moved Mr Asbo away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself. His behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises - and a marshal was employed during a university rowing race to stop him injuring students. It has previously been reported how Asboy was seen attacking punters, birds and even a cow. He also injured a canoeist and a swimmer.

The Conservative know that they need to turn large parts of the country blue on May 7. And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate Alec Shelbrooke in Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.

After months of speculation - and years of her friends' doubts - Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has admitted she never had cancer. With her business empire destroyed and her online community in tatters, Gibson today admitted her fatal cancer 'diagnoses' were lies. 'No. None of it is true,' she said, during a series of interviews published in the latest edition of the Australian Women's Weekly. In the interviews - which questioned her relationship with the truth and her understanding of cancer - Gibson said she was not seeking forgiveness. 'I don't want forgiveness. I just think (it) was the responsible thing to do. Above anything, I would like people to say, 'Okay, she's human'. Gibson's confession was the first time she has spoken publicly since - under fire from furious former fans - she told Daily Mail Australia she feared for her family's safety. Scroll down for video . Ms Gibson revealed the truth of her cancer diagnosis in an interview . Ms Gibson, pictured kissing her son Olivier, 4, on the head, said: 'None of it was true' Her business empire in tatters and her relationship with her fans broken, Ms Gibson is thought to be struggling financially. The Women's Weekly said she was not paid for her interview . Ms Gibson's interview will be published in this month's edition of the Australian Women's Weekly . The wellness blogger was a prominent Australian social media personality. Her Instagram fan base ballooned after she 'revealed' she had prolonger her life by embracing an alternative lifestyle. Her 'whole foods' business became famously successful. Penguin published her recipe book and her app was to be offered on the Apple Watch. But it all fell apart last month after revelations emerged Ms Gibson had failed to fulfil promised donations to various charities. Friends then began to cast doubts about her cancer diagnoses. She then tearfully 'admitted' she may have been 'misdiagnosed' by a 'Dr Phil'. The  Weekly insists it did not pay for the story and that it was approached by Ms Gibson's 'people', the Melbourne 'corporate advisory' firm Bespoke Approach. Ms Gibson said her partner, Clive Rothwell, was sticking by her in spite of the controversy. But she said he had taken a 'stern' line with her and insisted she play a straight bat. 'He’s been very stern, along the lines of, ‘I just want you to acknowledge where you’ve f***ed up and try not to smooth over that,' she was quoted saying. In the article, titled 'My Lifelong Struggle With The Truth', Ms Gibson also said she had been forced to raise herself from the day she started school. She said she took upon common household responsibilities, such as bringing her brother to school and making lunches. But she would not provide her mother's name or contact details to the magazine. In her previous interview, Ms Gibson said she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion'. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) was also a popular app. It will not appear on the Apple Watch any longer . But she took aim at many of her former fans who she believed had responded 'maliciously' - claiming that her son's childcare details, home address and floor plan were published online. Former friends had called upon Ms Gibson to 'come clean' with the truth about her situation and had long privately questioned the veracity of her story. Authorities told Daily Mail Australia  at the beginning of April that Ms Gibson is still facing an official investigation. A former friend of Ms Gibson directly called on her to 'come clean' in an interview with Daily Mail Australia in March. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want'

A ‘unique and beautiful’ teenage girl was killed by a driver who crashed a stolen car while drunk and high on cocaine and cannabis. Xana Doyle, 19, was a passenger in the Toyota Avensis, which flipped and landed on its roof in an accident in the early hours of the morning. Driver Sakhawat Ali, 23, was more than twice the drink-drive limit and had been taking class A and B drugs before getting behind the wheel. Xana Doyle (pictured) was killed after driver Sakhawat Ali crashed a stolen car while high on drugs . The Toyota Avensis flipped and landed on its roof after the crash in the early hours of the morning in January . A court heard he was driving at ‘excessive speed’ in the moments before the crash, which did not involve any other vehicle. Miss Doyle, who suffered a ‘blunt head injury’, was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales. Ali admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday. Judge Neil Bidder QC told the court: ‘The driver was well over twice the drink-drive limit and it is accepted there was excessive speed.’ The judge said he wanted more information on how much cocaine and cannabis the driver had taken on the night of the smash before sentencing. Ali, of Newport, was remanded in custody ahead of a hearing in July. Sakhawat Ali (pictured right) admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking . The driver’s cousin, Shabaz Ali, 21, admitted allowing himself to be carried in a stolen car following the smash in January this year. The July hearing will decide whether he ‘contributed’ to the accident by pulling the handbrake from the back seat. Floral tributes were left at the scene of the accident and hundreds of people attended the funeral of Miss Doyle, a former Duffryn High School student, in January. In a tribute, her mother Emma O’Donoghue wrote that Xana was an ‘unusual name for a unique and beautiful girl’. Before the crash, Miss Doyle, from Newport, had recently begun working at Wetherspoons as a cook and was also a trained beautician after completing an apprenticeship. Ms O’Donoghue said yesterday: ‘No sentence will ever give me back my daughter or my children their sister. She is dearly missed and this terribly traumatic experience will remain with us for ever. ‘I am pleased that Sakhawat Ali has pleaded guilty, not that he could dispute any of the evidence presented. Miss Doyle suffered a 'blunt head injury' and was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales . Ali was remanded in custody and a hearing in July will determine if his cousin also contributed to the crash . ‘Xana was a beautiful, funny and loving girl and every day is a struggle to live on without her in our lives, we can only hope that justice is served and those responsible are held accountable.’ Paying tribute to Miss Doyle at her funeral, her mother said: ‘You had a smile that would stop this world spinning around. ‘I always knew that you were kind and loving and even through your difficult teenage years you never forgot to tell me how much you loved me and appreciated my support. ‘In the last two years you blossomed into a beautiful young woman, independent and hard-working, making us all so proud of you.’ She added that she had fond memories of her daughter playing and fooling around with her sisters, Lauren and Eve, and her brother Zane. Miss Doyle, whose white coffin was adorned with red roses, gave ‘unquivering friendship and support’ to her friends and family throughout her life, her mother added.

A young woman has managed to find her doppelgänger after launching a campaign on Facebook as a social experiment - and their likeness is mind-blowing. Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old  TV presenter from Dublin, teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed Twin Strangers to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days, and were soon inundated with submissions from all over the world. Incredibly, Niamh found her match in Karen Branigan, 29, a fellow Ireland native who lives just an hour down the road, making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together. Scroll down for video . Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Speaking to MailOnline about her first meeting with Karen, Niamh said: I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the entire duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face, and some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, "Oh my God that’s my face." 'I can’t remember the number of times I said "this is so freaky". It was truly amazing.' Karen, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Niamh has a brother and two sisters, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Niamh said the pair got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities.

'I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me' Niamh (right) said about Karen (left) Niamh added, 'I can’t remember the number of times I said "this is so freaky". It was truly amazing' 'I would say Karen is the shyer of the two of us,' Niamh remarked. 'But then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me. 'I knew what search I was embarking on. I’m the weirdo that contacted Karen out of the blue and asked her to meet me in person.' Since meeting, Niamh and Karen - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly'. Karen (right) turned out to be a fellow Ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from Niamh (left), making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together . She added, 'Some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, "Oh my God that’s my face"' While Niamh appears to have beaten her fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry and 22-year-old Terence, hands down, the search isn't over until April 27. 'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry says. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!'

Since meeting, Niamh (right) and Karen (left) - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly' Feedback: Shocked reactions to Karen and Niamh's story have flooded in from far and wide . Challenge: Niamh's (right) fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry (left) and 22-year-old Terence (centre), are still looking for their doppelgängers, and the search isn't over until April 27 . Niamh, who is still promoting the project across social media with Harry and Terence as interest spreads, says there will be no prize for the winner, just 'pride'. They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' Niamh states. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?'

It may have been invented for students to use. But youngsters appear to be deserting Facebook in droves because it is now so popular with their parents – and grandparents. Almost a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’. The trend comes as increasing numbers of older users turn to the social network to stay in touch and share family pictures. Nearly 60 per cent of Britons aged over 55 now have a Facebook account, according to research. Facebook has even started running television adverts to entice the so-called ‘silver surfers’ to join. Now a survey of around 2,000 Britons has revealed that it is having the opposite effect on youngsters. ‘As parents are signing up, their children are logging off to maintain privacy,’ said Lord Jim Knight, chairman of online lobby group the Tinder Foundation. In the poll, a third of Facebook users are said to have blocked a family member so they can no longer see their account or do not receive automatic updates. The survey did not take account of the number of youngsters who have effectively blocked their family members by refusing to add them as a ‘Facebook friend’ in the first place. One in ten people aged 16 to 34 signed up to other platforms so they could remain ‘under the radar of their parents’. But whilst youngsters may be leaving Facebook, they are not giving up on social media altogether. More than half said they had joined Twitter, where only 13 per cent of ‘silver surfers’ said they have accounts. Meanwhile, about 40 per cent of youngsters use the picture-sharing website Instagram, according to the study commissioned by Halifax and carried out by Opinium Research. Logging off: Nearly a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their facebook accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’ Around the same proportion use Snapchat, a social media platform which automatically deletes messages shortly after they are sent. The picture was very different among the over-55s. Just three percent have an Instagram account and even fewer – around one percent – use Snapchat. The way people use these different social platforms is also changing. Around a fifth of those aged 16 to 34 use their smartphones at family dinners, posing a threat to the precious mealtimes that used to be the cornerstone on family life. By comparison, just one percent of silver surfers use their smartphones during a meal with their offspring.

Alan Pardew has warned Crystal Palace's Barclays Premier League admirers that if they want to sign Yannick Bolasie this summer then the bidding will have to start at £20million. It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.' Bolasie scores against Sunderland as he helped Crystal Palace beat the struggling Premier League side .

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini accepts his side are now facing a fight to stay in the Champions League places. City appear to have lost too much ground to Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race and their recent form has led to a further worry, with the sides behind them catching fast. The fading champions could even find themselves in fourth place before they next play - at Crystal Palace on Monday - if results go against them over the weekend. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) shakes hands with David Silva during Manchester City training . Martin Demichelis (left), Wilfried Bony (centre) and Fernando during Friday's session . Frank Lampard (right) looks to play a pass as he and his team-mates are put through their paces . This is not a battle they envisaged having to fight at the start of the campaign but Pellegrini realises nothing can be taken for granted after a frustrating second half of the season. Pellegrini said: 'I think in this league you can never be sure you are going to have a Champions League place. You have six or seven teams that, from the beginning, all of them play for that position. 'At the moment, for the whole year, we have been in a position of the Champions League. I hope that we will continue.' Pellegrini believes his side are now in a battle for the Champions League places and not the title . Manchester City have struggled to keep up with Chelsea, who are closing in on the Premier League trophy . The ramifications of dropping out of the top four, however, are not really something Pellegrini wants to consider, given that he still has hopes of landing the title. With just eight games remaining and a significant deficit to make up on Chelsea that looks a forlorn task, but Pellegrini is not giving up. The Chilean said: 'Of course if we want to continue in the first position of the table we must not drop any more points. It is easy to say but not easy to do it. 'We just know that from now until the end of the season we will try to win all the games and we will see if we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end.' Sergio Aguero has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks but will hope to find the net on Monday . James Milner is in line to return after withdrawing from the England squad with a knee problem . City will hope to be at full strength for the trip to Selhurst Park. Pellegrini reported nothing other than 'small problems' when asked about any injury concerns at his pre-match press conference. That means a likely return for key midfielder Yaya Toure, who missed the 3-0 victory over West Brom a fortnight ago with an Achilles problem but has since played for Ivory Coast. Fellow midfielder James Milner has also been troubled by a knee problem in recent weeks - and withdrew from England's midweek friendly in Italy - but the issue is not thought serious.

Radamel Falcao could still sign permanently for Manchester United after it emerged that chief executive Ed Woodward held talks with Monaco on Sunday over the striker’s future. Falcao, who has scored just four times for United since his season-long loan move from Monaco, drew another blank at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea on Saturday evening. But Woodward told Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev last Sunday that they would make a decision on the right to sign him permanently at the end of the season. Manchester United could sign Radamel Falcao permanently after holding talks with Monaco on Sunday . The striker has endured a frustrating season on loan at Man United and has managed just four league goals . Vasilyev said: ‘I saw the Manchester United people last Sunday and they have not yet decided if they would exercise the option.. ‘It’s not his best season, but they kept the opportunity to make a decision at the end of the season.’ Although it seems highly unlikely that United will keep the Colombian striker, Falcao has been given hope of a second chance under Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Under the terms of the original loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the forward, but it has since emerged that Monaco are willing to negotiate on the transfer fee after a disappointing season at United. Vasilyev added: ‘We are not in any other negotiations, even if big clubs are interested. The decision is with Manchester, then we will discuss with the player what he wants. I would like to have more visibility.’ Falcao missed last summer’s World Cup in Brazil following a knee injury and it is thought he rushed his recovery in an attempt to play in the tournament for Colombia. Under the terms of the loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the striker but Monaco are willing to negotiate . Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward spoke with Monaco president Vasim Vasilyev on Sunday . Vasilyev added: ‘He had mishaps in Monaco. He had problems with the coach Claudio Ranieri, there was a lack of understanding. ‘He was also seriously injured and missed the World Cup. In late August, he came to tell us that he wanted to play at a higher level.” Ranieri has since been replaced by Leonardo Jardim and he has backed Falcao to rediscover his goalscoring form after a frustrating season at United. Jardim, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Juventus in the Stade Louis II, is preparing for his return at the end of the season. Jardim, speaking ahead of his side's home clash with Juventus, is confident Falcao can get back to his best . The Portuguese coach said: ‘He’s not had a great season that is true, but I’m sure he can come back to the levels he was at in the past - that much I’m convinced about. ‘It’s not a question for me, but for the players, I’ve only worked with him for a month.’ Monaco lost the first leg last week in the Juventus Stadium to a controversial penalty and face Massimiliano Allegri’s team in the second leg.

An aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed Germanwings passenger plane may had its electronics 'hacked' before it crashed killing all 150 on board. The theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected Financial Times newspaper from aviation boss Matt Andersson, president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace. The French Alps tragedy which occurred on the flight between Barcelona to Dusseldorf has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28. He is believed to have barricaded himself in the cockpit of the GermanWings A320 Airbus before flying the packed plane into the mountainside as the captain fought desperately to get inside. Scroll down for video . Disaster: An aviation expert says an external factor like 'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the Germanwings plane crash that claimed 150 lives . Tragedy: The crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who investigators say locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet . Investigation: But Matt Andersson - president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace - says any number of causes could have caused the crash . Doomed: Recordings from the cockpit suggested that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (left) locked himself in the cockpit while the Captain Patrick Sondenheimer desperately tried to break in . Investigators point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer. Mr Andersson says the French accident investigators are clear that the stricken plane 'accelerated in its descent'. But he writes in the FT: 'That may be, but it could be from any number of causes, including external electronic hacking into the aircraft's control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception.' 'This is one reason military and head-of-state aircraft are generally installed with specific shielding and additional active protective measures,' and he stresses: 'Civilian aircraft are not.' Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries and come to a firm conclusion. He added: 'The public should patiently wait for a through, multi-party professional air safety investigation, while maintaining an independence of judgment over preliminary official hypotheses.' Setting out his doubts about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary findings, Mr Andersson said: 'Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) of the Germanwings flight 9525 have yet to be subject to international standards. 'Until they are, many broad assertions currently presented to the public may turn out to be erroneous, misleading or in some cases lead to improper or counterproductive regulatory and other reactions –including misplaced liability, financial and insurance claims.' Damaged: Despite revelations from the plane's flight data recorders (pictured), Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries . Aftermath: He claims passenger planes do not have the same level of protection as military jets and someone could have hacked into its 'control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception' Since the crash, European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck, requiring a member of cabin crew to step in if one of the two pilots leaves the cockpit. Mr Andersson writes in the FT that the 'slow drip' of piecemeal judgments from preliminary assessments of data can be counterproductive. He said the European Cockpit Association representing nearly 40,000 professional pilots 'has rightly criticised the premature release' of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder. Investigators say this highlights the co-pilot breathing while locked in the cockpit while the pilot beats on the door outside. Protection: Since the crash which is believed to be caused by 28-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck . Police carried out forensic searches on Lubitz's and his parents house after it emerged that he 'deliberately' crashed the Airbus A320 jet into the Alps . He believes premature release 'could arguably prejudice a formal technical assessment' and Mr Andersson is not the only aviation expert to speculate on the plane being 'hacked'. Former commercial pilot Jay Rollins told US television channel MSNBC last month: 'This aircraft is highly computerised. 'There's one possibility that no-one has brought up. I wonder – could this be a hacking incident?' He drew parallels with the loss of a US drone over Iran, which some blamed on electronic hacking: 'Suddenly the aircraft responding to outside forces. 'If something like that were going on it would be very disturbing for the pilot.'

Lindsay Lohan has been living in London for the past year and says she likes it so much, she doesn't see herself returning to the States any time soon. The 28-year-old flame-haired beauty recently spent a stint on the stage, starring in a West End production of David Mamet’s Speed The Plow - for which she received lukewarm reviews - and seems intent on remaining in the UK for the foreseeable future. ‘[London] feels like home, I miss it every time I have to leave for work and can’t wait to get back,’ Lindsay told Homme Style Magazine while posing for a stunning and seductive shoot for the publication. ‘I go back to NYC and LA for family and work.’ Scroll down for video . Staying put: Lindsay Lohan says she feels 'at home' in London and has no plans to return to the States just yet . Fleur Du Mal Leather Corset . Available at Forward by Elyse Walker . Visit site . We haven't heard much from Lindsay in the US since she moved across the pond to London. But if her latest photo shoot for Homme Style magazine is any indication, she's making a comeback in a major way. The Mean Girls star showed of her svelte figure in a series of racy ensembles by Moschino and Agent Provacateur. Here she poses wearing nothing but a Fleur Du Mal leather corset, La Perla panties, and a pair of Moschino gloves. Corsets were hot on the Spring runways at Givenchy and Versace and continue to be a wardrobe staple for sultry celebs like Madonna and Kim Kardashian. Lindsay's leather number is available to purchase for just under $1,000. That's quite a big budget for lingerie, so we've come up with some alternatives that are less pricey but still have major sex appeal. Style them with a pencil skirt and blazer on your next night out and all eyes will be on you. Jezebel Embrace Strapless Corset at JCPenney . Visit site .

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same "situations" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'

Designer Lilly Pulitzer's family learned that it's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the 'Pink Sunday' rush for the late Ms Pulitzer’s eponymous brand’s brightly-colored, limited edition collaboration at Target. The 250-piece Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the #LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores.

Protesters have demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons during a protest against the gentrification of South London. The store front of its Brixton branch was covered in shattered glass while 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' was spray painted in black across their housing advertisements. A police spokesman confirmed that one man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Thousands of people turned up for the event organised by the Reclaim Brixton group who were demonstrating against local residents and businesses being priced out of the trendy area. One of the event's organisers denounced the violent actions of 'one idiot' but told MailOnline there could be a reason Foxtons - which has a reputation for selling expensive homes - has been 'continuously targeted'. Scroll down for video . Vandal: One vandal smashed the front window of Foxtons Brixton branch (pictured) during a 'wholly peaceful' protest against rising house prices in London . Violent: The lone protester demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons, who have a reputation for selling expensive houses . Defaced: The vandal then spray painted 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' on the estate agent's housing advertisements . Reputation: A spokesperson for Reclaim Brixton - who organised the event - denounced the man's violent actions but suggested there could be a reason Foxtons is 'continuously targeted' Motive: Cyndi Anaso said she is not happy about the vandalism but told MailOnline 'it suggests there's a reason they are being targeted' Response: Police at the scene in Brixton (pictured) had to us CS spray to disperse a group of violent protesters . Cyndi Anaso from Reclaim Brixton told MailOnline said she was 'saddened' that someone behaved 'deviantly' during a wholly peaceful demonstration. But she claims the upmarket estate agents have been targeted before, adding: 'Foxtons has a very poor reputation when it comes to expensive properties and unfortunately.' 'There's a message in it which I'm not happy about but it still suggests there's a reason they are being targeted. 'There's never an endorsement of the attack but nothing else on the day can be considered even slightly violent.' 'I don't even think it's right to apologise for these individuals because every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window.' Foxtons is widely considered as a sign of gentrification and its presence is an indicates that an area either is or has the potential to become very affluent. The Reclaim Brixton event was planned to demonstrate against the rising property prices in London which the group believes is 'displacing the city's communities'. A statement on the Facebook page for the event said: 'The fight against gentrification starts here! Brixton is widely known for its vibrancy, which is another word for social and cultural diversity. Keeping watch: There is still a 'police presence' outside the vandalised store in Brixton, South London following the incident . Defence: Sympathisers and Brixton locals used Twitter to condemn the attention being given to the 'isolated' act of vandalism . Break-in: The Metropolitan Police (pictured) also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall, but were removed shortly after and no arrests were made . 'But Brixton's vibrancy now has a question mark on it. Will Brixton turn into a living museum or will it live?' But alongside images of people protesting peacefully on the streets, social media has been flooded with images of hordes pushing past police and the Foxtons window being destroyed. A police spokesman added: 'A group of protesters then made their way to Brixton Road where the window of a commercial premises was smashed and graffiti sprayed on the building.' Police used CS spray on 'a small group of protesters' who went into Brixton Police Station at around 4.10pm before being removed shortly afterwards. The Metropolitan Police also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall at around 3.15pm, saying: 'Officers entered the building and the protesters were removed.' Grace Lally from Lambeth Housing Activists said the demonstration had attracted thousands of people. Smashed: A Reclaim Brixton spokesperson said: 'Every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window' She added: 'The protest has been lively and strong and loud and people have hung banners off the town hall, blocked the streets and marched through Brixton a number of times and stopped traffic.' Ms Lally insisted the protest was 'really lively' but there had been 'no violence or trouble or anything like that'. Those sympathetic to Reclaim Brixton's protest and locals of the area have taken to Twitter to denounce isolated incidents of violence. Regarding the smashed window, Vanessa Furey from London said: 'Whilst sympathetic to the sentiment, idiots who have done this will have taken away what Reclaim Brixton was about.' And Louise Ridley wrote: 'I live in Brixton. I want people to know about extortionate rents and evictions. But I don't want windows smashed, anywhere.'

(CNN)Pushed to his limits, a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class. In an email to his students, Irwin Horwitz accused them of "backstabbing, game playing, cheating, lying, fighting." The professor at the Texas A&M University Galveston Campus expected his missive would create some conflict, but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly. Those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage. The story went viral. Suddenly, his name was spreading on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, accompanied by the kind of strong, unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you've never met. He was a hero who taught today's entitled youth a much-needed lesson, or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit. One thing was certain: He, and his employer, were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for. "I did what I did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the Internet," Horwitz said. "I will stand by what I did, but I'm not career suicidal." Texas A&M says Horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching. But Horwitz, a nontenure-track professor in the maritime administration program, is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs. Horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial, and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class. The day before writing to his students, Horwitz wrote a similar email to the CEO of the Texas A&M Galveston Campus and to the school's chief academic officer. "I have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful, dishonest and disrespectful" as his current strategic management class, he wrote to the administrators. He accused the students of shirking responsibility, making excuses and complaining their way to better grades. He would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class, Horwitz wrote. "The class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic," he wrote. "But they are your problem now." It was the next day that Horwitz wrote to the students, calling the class "an embarrassment in general," and said that "I am frankly and completely disgusted." Once his words echoed in traditional and social media, the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone. The story was such a talker that even The Onion offered a parody. "I'm not looking to fail students," Horwitz said. "I don't get a bonus for failing students." "The letter sounded a little bit more definite than I wanted it to," he added. He never actually changed anyone's grade. There were some students he wasn't going to fail, he said, and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out. But Horwitz stands by his tough stance; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed, he said. The course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses. "I had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break-even analysis," the professor said. "If you cannot do a break-even analysis, then you don't deserve a bachelor's degree in business." His other complaint was about professionalism. Horwitz said students would swear at him, cheat and spread rumors about him online. This is related to their grades, he said, because dealing with people you don't like is a business skill. On online message boards, users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story. One purported student called Horwitz "a little obnoxious," but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules. Should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral? The fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public, but maybe there is more to it. The situation hits on a popular argument on the media and Internet: What do we think of millennials? Reflecting on his most recent class, Horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered. He mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics, and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration. The other factor is a failure of K-12 education, said Horwitz, who has met college students who don't know how to convert fractions to decimals. "What I'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance," he said. In a statement, Patrick Louchouarn, the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at Texas A&M Galveston Campus, said the entire class will not be failed. "Each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester," Louchouarn said. "The university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies." The flurry of attention is unwelcome and Horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia. But it's likely his story will have a short shelf life. People probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline. But he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere. He said he feels a public shaming of sorts. Online public shaming has become a research topic of its own. People who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance. "This is really destroying my life," Horwitz said.

A northern Indiana pizzeria that closed after its owner said his religious beliefs wouldn't allow him to cater a gay wedding opened Thursday to a full house of friends, regulars and people wanting to show their support. 'It's a relief to get going again and try to get back to normal,' said Kevin O'Connor, owner of Memories Pizza. O'Connor closed the shop for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana. Scroll down for video .

O'Connor, the  61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming . O'Connor said the criticism hasn't changed his beliefs. He said gays are welcome in his restaurant in the small, one-traffic-light town of Walkerton, 20 miles southwest of South Bend, but that he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his Christian beliefs. 'I'd do the same thing again. It's my belief. It's our belief. It's what we grew up on,' he said. 'I'm just sorry it comes to this because neither one of us dislike any of those people. I don't hold any grudges.' A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours.

The 61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. 'I enjoy it. I don't want to leave here,' he said. 'I want this to be something that my daughter can enjoy.' Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming. Anger: A protester is seen outside Memories Pizza in this photo with a sign that reads 'Bigots' Uproar: Protesters (like the ones seen here on March 28) have been upset over Indiana passing a new law, which critics said allows businesses the ability to refuse service to gay customers on religious grounds. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana . Family: O'Connor, seen with his daughter Crystal, says gays are welcome in his restaurant, but he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his beliefs . The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. O'Connor says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders . 'We were like, `Stop! Stop! Stop!'" she said. 'It was really making us uncomfortable,' her father said. The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. He says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders. There were no protests as of 7 p.m. Jeanne and Ken Gumm from outside LaPorte, about 20 miles northwest of Walkerton, said they had been waiting for the pizzeria to reopen so they could show their support. 'We couldn't wait to get down here," said Ken Gumm, 66, a tank truck driver. 'To us this whole thing isn't about gay marriage. It's mostly about freedom of religion.'

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today left the door open to a second referendum on Scottish independence before 2020. Before last year's historic vote, Scottish nationalists insisted it was a once-in-a-generation chance to decided on the future of the 300-year-old Union. But Ms Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' In September's vote, 55 per cent of Scots backed the idea of remaining in the United Kingdom. Alex Salmond said the vote was an 'opportunity of a lifetime' and two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: 'We have always said it's a once in a generation thing.' But in a series of TV election debates between Scottish leaders, Ms Sturgeon has shifted her position and today left open the possibility that the promise of another vote could be included in a future SNP manifesto. Under pressure she said that 'something would have to change' before she promised a referendum, and people would have to vote for it. She said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, there is not another referendum on the cards. 'In order for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future, something significant would have to change from the situation we had last year in the referendum.' Ms Sturgeon, who was campaigning in Paisley today, left open the idea of demanding a referendum in next year's Scottish Parliament elections . Opponents claim Ms Sturgeon had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on a referendum, after insisting last year's vote was a once in a generation event . During a fractious and at times shouty debate on BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged her to rule out another vote. Ms Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: 'You clearly don't want to tell people before they vote in this election, what will happen in the next election. 'You have a conference coming up in September, you have 80,000 new members who might be popping along, are you going to put a motion at your conference on this to put a referendum into your next manifesto?' Ms Sturgeon said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, I haven't published the 2016 manifesto. It will be this time next year before we publish the 2016 one.' Mr Rennie said the SNP leader had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on another referendum. He said: 'People need to know whether their vote for the SNP this time round will trigger a referendum in the SNP's manifesto in 2016. Nicola Sturgeon's refusal to answer this basic question makes clear that Scotland faces neverendum. 'It matters because during the referendum we know the SNP took their eye off the ball. As a result, public services were neglected. 'We have seen from Canada the economic impact of an uncertain constitutional environment. Quebec lost jobs and wealth. That damaged the province in the long term. I want a Scotland which builds a stronger economy and a fairer society, balancing the books and delivering more powers.' During a TV debate, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged Ms Sturgeon to come clean on her plans for Scotland . Ms Sturgeon later accused her opponents of 'reviving Project Fear'. The First Minister was questioned about SNP plans to increase Scotland's financial powers, which economists have suggested would leave a £7.6 billion spending gap, during a third televised election debate in under a week. Ms Sturgeon said that full fiscal autonomy would take several years to implement but with new powers Scotland would start growing its economy and revenues. She said: 'This week we've seen the Project Fear that dominated the referendum revived by these three unionist parties, trying to talk down Scotland and assert that we're not capable of running our own affairs.' Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said: 'This (the figure) didn't come from us. You're right in saying this came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It also came from a group of Scottish-based economists that projected the gap to be bigger.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: 'To make this £7.6 billion up Scotland would have to grow at twice the rate of the rest of entire advanced world, so how would you do that Nicola?'

A night of violence gave way to a day of mourning Sunday for a man who died after sustaining serious injuries while in the custody of Baltimore police. Over several hours on Sunday afternoon, a steady stream of mourners filed into the Vaughn Green East funeral home for a wake for Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who died a week after an encounter with police left him with grave spinal injuries. Mourners passed by Gray's silk-draped, white coffin where he lay dressed in a white shirt, black pants, white sneakers and an all-white Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap. Scroll down for video .

Above the lid to the coffin was a floral arrangement and inside the lid was a pillow with a screen-printed picture of Gray flanked by doves and the quote, 'Peace, Y'all' at the bottom edge. Mourners also gathered outside. Some held up signs that read, 'We remember Freddie' and 'Our Hearts Are With The Gray Family.' Melissa McDonald, 36, who said she was Gray's cousin, wore a shirt with 'Freddie Forever' printed on the back. She described her cousin as a nonviolent person. 'He didn't deserve to die the way he did,' she said. A number of mourners like Tina Covington, 46, said they didn't know the family but came to express their condolences. Covington said she has a son near Freddie Gray's age. Gray was detained on April 12 after he ran away from police. He asked for an inhaler as he screamed in pain during the arrest and requested medical attention, but was denied . Gray, who was arrested for carrying a switchblade knife, died a week after the incident from a severed spine . 'It hits home. It really does. It's a reality check,' said Covington, whose son is 27. Covington said that 'there is something going on in the police department that needs to change.' Gray's funeral is planned for Monday. At a church service earlier Sunday, Pastor Jamal Bryant told churchgoers, including members of Gray's family, at Empowerment Temple AME Church that 'somebody is going to have to pay' for Gray's death.

Barricade: Police stand in helmets near Pratt Street after a march to City Hall for Freddie Gray, Saturday, April 25, 2015 in Baltimore . Roughly 1,200 protesters gathered at City Hall on Saturday afternoon, officials said, to protest Gray's death, which has prompted near-daily demonstrations since he died April 19. Gray was arrested one week before that when officers chased him through a West Baltimore neighborhood and dragged him into a police van. However, a smaller group splintered off and looted a convenience store and smashed storefront windows. A protester tossed a flaming metal garbage can toward police officers in riot gear trying to push back the crowd. Earlier, a group of protesters smashed windows of at least three police cars. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a long-time congressman representing Baltimore's 7th District, told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that there is deep frustration over the case. 'Mr. Gray died a week ago. And I think the thing that upset so many people was the fact that here's a young man. We still don't know exactly why he was arrested,' Cummings said. 'We do know that he was hollering out for aid. He was not given aid after being arrested. ... A lot of people are very, very frustrated as to trying to figure out what happened here, and it's very upsetting.'

Gathering at the ball game: Protestors gather outside of Oriole Park at Camden Yards before a baseball game between the Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles after a rally for Freddie Gray, Saturday, April 25, 2015, in Baltimore . Police acknowledged Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested — before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the Police Department's policy. Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray asked for medical help several times, beginning before he was placed in the van. After a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.

A volleyball-playing feline was picked to star in a national TV advert after seeing off competition from thousands of gifted animals. Tortoiseshell Mimi became an internet sensation after her owner uploaded clips of her playing the sport to Facebook. The 30-second-video was shared by thousands of people around the world and features the one-year-old cat playing with 15-year-old Joshua Teague. Joshua’s dad Phil, 56, a computer programmer, bought the cat with his wife Christine, 45, when she was eight-weeks-old in December 2013 from a seller who lived in Birmingham. Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert, which was broadcast last Wednesday (15), after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group earlier this month. He said: 'All the family were really excited to see the advert. Mimi the cat appears in a 30-second video showing her unique ball skills . 'We had everyone around so we could watch it together and we told all our friends that it was going to be on. 'I am really proud that our video was chosen out of thousands of entries. 'It was completely by chance that I uploaded the video on to the Pets At Home Facebook page. The cat is seen playing volleyball with 15-year-old Joshua Teague in the hallway . Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group . 'I just saw something on there asking people to share videos and pictures of their pets so that’s what I did. I didn’t even realise it was a competition. 'The video showed Mimi playing volleyball with my son where he would throw the ball at her and she would keep batting it back. 'I had no idea it was competition so I thought it was a joke when I received an email on April 1 saying our video had been chosen for a national commercial. Mimi is seen in the video batting the ball back to Joshua every time he throws it her way . 'This kind of thing just never happens. 'She is a very talented cat. She has done many times since. 'I think she could get her own TV show.' Administrative assistant Christine said: 'I didn’t even know Phil had uploaded the video on Facebook so I thought it was an April Fools’ joke when he told me about it. 'We normally just skip the adverts when we watch programmes but we made sure to watch this one. 'Although she’s only in the advert for a few seconds, it’s nice to see her on it. 'I never thought when I filmed the video that it would end up on TV.'

'This new infant 'brew' could seriously harm babies,' a spokeswoman for the Dieticians Association of Australia told News Corp Australia. 'The authors seem to have made a serious mistake with this second version of their liver and broth recipe, suggesting they do not understand the basic scientific and nutrition information relevant for infant feeding. 'They have said publicly that they have tried to make it safe by reworking the original recipe, and increasing the age for which it's suggested from 0-6 months to now be 6-12 months, but they have failed spectacularly to meet any safe standards.' The paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle . Evans's co-authors, wellness blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padrin, told Channel 7 last week the dangerous formula had been reworked and renamed 'Happy Tummy Brew'. The pair told the program the recipe had changed. 'We added vitamin C and some calcium,'Carr told The Morning Show. It comes after Evans' recently shared two stories on his social media accounts of women who claimed the paleo diet helped alleviate the symptoms of their multiple sclerosis. A 30-year-old woman, Hollie, wrote she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in September 2013. She said that she endured months of  constant dizziness, altered temperature perception, extreme fatigue, numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression. But after jumping on the Paleo diet bandwagon, Hollie claimed she has not suffered any MS symptoms over the past 12 months, her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever. Hollie's experience led the celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000-plus followers on Facebook on Saturday. Pete Evans has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis . 'WOW this is powerful story on MS, thanks for sharing Hollie.. it will make your heart sing.. it has mine, please tag and share wide!' Evans wrote. The Australian chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg, another MS sufferer. The woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on Evans' 10 weeks Paleo program. The celebrity chef has been a proud paleo advocate . 'I have had a lot of health issues the past years, mainly auto-immune stuff including MS,' she wrote in the online post. 'Having MS means I'm always sapped of energy, have numbness, pins and needles, pain, poor concentration, etc. Not any more!' Marg said she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs. 'No way on earth I could have done that 10 weeks ago,' she wrote. 'My concentration and memory is much better and I can also plan better. I'm not off my MS meds yet but I am off my Thyroid and Reflux meds. 'Thanks so much Pete and team for helping me get my life back. You've made this road so easy. As an added bonus I've gone from a size 16 to a size 12.' The My Kitchen Rules judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy. But, Hollie praised Evans for his endorsement of the controversial diet, and said 'the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable'. 'I have been inspired by your encouragement, great recipes and educated by the accurate information you provide,' Hollie wrote. 'Pete, I thank you so very much for bringing paleo in to the mainstream - people no longer look at me as though I'm a weirdo for following this way of life.' In another recent Facebook post, the Australian chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg who also suffers from MS . Evans has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman 'diet' LaTrobe University Associate Professor of Dietetics Catherine Itsiopoulos pointed out Hollie's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the Paleo lifestyle. 'Her diet may have been poor previously,' Dr Itsiopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we don't know what her diet and eating habits were like before. 'By eating lean meat, good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together. 'But we don't actually know if her condition is cured so it's hard to advocate on because there's no scientific evidence to back this up.' The paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar . University of South Australia Professor of Population, Health and Nutrition Kerin O'Dea said while the diet seemed to have worked for Hollie, it might not work for others. 'Pete can share whatever he likes to his followers but there's never going to be one magic bullet to cure an illness or a serious disease,' Dr O'Dea told Daily Mail Australia. 'Someone reporting an anecdote might be true in one person's case but it's very difficult to imply it to others, which can be quite misleading for people. The paleo style of eating, which Pete Evans is a proud supporter of, has been sweeping across the globe . 'They could feel failure when it doesn't work for them, especially when they try to cure a serious condition like this. 'I wouldn't recommend any particular diet for anyone suffering any type of illnesses.' The paleo style of eating, which Evans is a proud supporter of, has swept  the globe and involves a high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruits, seeds and nuts.

(CNN)A popular Chinese television host known for impromptu satire is now the subject of controversy after being caught on camera cursing the late Chairman Mao Zedong. Bi Fujian, who works for state-run China Central Television, was filmed at a dinner party singing a revolutionary song that eulogizes the Communist Party's early years when he started going off script. "The Communist Party, Chairman Mao. Don't mention that old son of a b***h. He made us suffer so bad," went Bi's improvised lyrics. The other dinner guests burst into laughter. Bi later apologized. "My personal speech has led to grave social consequences, and I feel remorseful for that. I hereby sincerely apologize to the public. As a public figure, I shall learn the lesson from this incident, adhering to strict self-discipline," he posted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform. Making disrespectful references to China's leaders in public is considered a taboo in China, even today. And Bi's comment was directed at the man regarded by many as the country's founding father -- despite his controversial reputation. The 75-second video clip, seemingly filmed on the cellphone of another dinner guest, was uploaded on Monday. Since then, it has been removed from video-sharing sites inside China, although it was still accessible on Weibo. It's unclear when the incident occurred, or what the relationsip was between the camera person and Bi. CCTV said it would investigate. "As a CCTV presenter, Bi Fujian's speech in the online video has led to grave social consequences," the network said in a statement posted on its Weibo account. CCTV did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Fondly known as "Grandpa Bi," the 56-year-old TV personality was born and grew up in the Mao era. The song Bi riffed on was part of a "red" Peking opera that was first performed in the late 1950s. It was popularized during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s -- which was launched by Mao -- when China was torn apart by violence and social unrest. The video quickly divided China's online community. Critics said Bi, as an influential public figure, deserved a harsh punishment. But others rushed to his defense, arguing that Bi was simply enjoying himself in a private setting and was set up by whoever uploaded the clip. The video also emerged just a day before the new head of CCTV started his job, leading some to wonder if it were a case of "a new broom sweeps clean." Mao still divides opinion in China. His giant portrait hangs on Beijing's Tiananmen Gate, and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital. But despite this reverence, Mao's is a deeply flawed legacy. Many remember him as a brutal dictator who inspired fear, paranoia and famine, and whose actions resulted in tens of millions of deaths. CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report.

A man vying to become the next Kentucky governor has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after a late local celebrity who bid five times for the title but never won enough votes. The 68-year-old Pulaski County resident, who was known as Terrill Wayne Newman until Tuesday, told the Lexington Herald-Leader he doesn't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will 'warm Galbraith's grave.' His predecessor, who died in 2012 from chronic emphysema, gained a following for his wit, sharp dress sense and support of legalizing marijuana. Terrill Wayne Newman (right), who is vying to become Governor of Kentucky, has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after the late local celebrity (left) who bid five times for the title but never won . The newly-christened Galbraith filed paperwork on Wednesday to run as an independent for the state's highest office. The Secretary of State's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by August 11 to get their names on the general election ballot. Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said. Galbraith says he and the late Galbraith were 'not friends per se,' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis. Dea Riley, who was the original Galbraith's running mate in 2011, said she thinks he would find the whole name change amusing. 'I can hear him now: "I'll tell the IRS to send him the tax bill,"' Riley said. But she also said the new Galbraith 'has very big shoes to fill' with his name and she hopes he will honor it. 'To have Gatewood's name and message prostituted, for the sake to garner political office, is a personal affront to me in that I was not only his running mate but equally his friend and confidant,' Riley said.

There looked to be so much bend on Leo Messi’s shot on the half hour at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night that if there had been no net to stop the ball it would kept on curling until it ended up back at the great man’s feet. The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted. Barcelona star duo Luis Suarez (right) and Lionel Messi embrace as Barcelona take a seven-point lead in La Liga . The Barcelona No 10 loses his markers in the Almeria penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike . Barcelona talisman Messi wheels away after opening the scoring  at the Nou Camp during a 4-0 victory over Almeria . Suarez followed Messi's lead by scoring a similar left-footed strike to double the Catalans lead with the first of his two goals . Barcelona defender Marc Bartra stuffs the ball under his shirt after netting a third with a headed goal on 75minutes . Barcelona (4-3-3): Bravo; Alves, Bartra, Mascherano, Adriano; Sergi Roberto, Xavi, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Pedro. Subs: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Mathieu, Pique, Iniesta, Rafinha, Neymar . Booked: Mascherano . Scorer: Messi 33', Suarez 55', Bartra 75', Suarez 90' Almeria (4-2-3-1): Julian; Ximo Navarro, Marin, Trujillo, Casado; Partey, Corona; Wellington Silva (Soriano), Espinosa (Mane), Edgar (Zongo); Bifouma. Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Julián Cuesta in the visitors’ goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Barça number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta’s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo’s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta’s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes. Almeria keeper Julian Cuesta uses any means necessary to keep the ball away from former Liverpool forward Luis Suarez (left) Barcelona stalwart Xavi (right) watches on as team-mate Messi tries a rare attempt using his head . Spain international Pedro (centre) was given an opportunity after Neymar was dropped to the bench to cope with hectic schedule . Everyone on the pitch can only watch as Messi's stunning left-foot strike curls into the bottom corner of the net . Brazil full-back Dani Alves rushes to congratulate team-mate Messi after he gives Barcelona a first half lead . The Argentina phenomenon celebrates scoring his 33rd league goal of the season so far . Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria’s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona’s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury. If they don’t do you with the magic of Messi and Suarez then they do you from a dead ball. Almeria had succumbed to all three threats.

Sandra Garratt was in constant agony after undergoing two operations before her death . A grandmother racked with constant pain jumped from the top of a multi-storey car park to end her suffering, her devastated husband has said. Sandra Garratt, 56, went through two years of agony following two back operations for a slipped disc and not even morphine could dull the pain. Last month doctors told the housewife there was nothing more they could do ease her suffering and this was the 'final straw', according to her husband Steve. On Good Friday, the mother of two left her home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after telling her husband she was 'just popping out'. But he became anxious for her welfare and he called the police. At 2.35pm, police and ambulance crews were called to the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, where they discovered Mrs Garratt's body. She had fallen more than 50ft from the top of an Asda supermarket multi-storey car park. Mr Garratt, 57, told how he gave up his job as a community transport driver last year to care for his wife. He said her suffering had intensified in the last 18 months of her life and the pain had spread to her legs, feet and fingers. He added: 'She was in pain every minute of every day. She was a happy lovely person but withdrew from her happy family life. 'Before there had been hope but when there was nothing they could do, it was the final straw. 'Everybody says the same – she is now free from the pain. That's the only bit of comfort. 'The doctors and GPs, within the scope of the NHS waiting lists and everything that goes on, did everything they could.' Mrs Garratt leaves behind daughter Lucy, 37, son Jonathan, 26, and two grandchildren, Joshua and Jessica. The coroner has been informed of her death. Mrs Garratt told her husband she was 'popping out' on Good Friday. Hours later her body was found at the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, West Midlands .

A young Star Wars fan, who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies’ creator George Lucas asking whether he would allow Jedi Knights to marry in the future, was elated to receive a reply granting his request. Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric told Inside Edition: 'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy was on hand to film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son, who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It’s very black and white. There’s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don’t have emotions, but they do. It’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'

The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 at auction. The unique psychedelic cartoon, which is hand-painted, depicts the eponymous submarine from the 1968 film in which the Fab Four travel to Pepperland to save it from the Blue Meanies. The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas, Texas, on Thursday . The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the Yellow Submarine film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The 1968 film starred The Beatles (above) It features handwritten notes instructing artists on the correct colours to use when recreating the submarine. More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch £10,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time. Yellow Submarine was a success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album a year later . The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. The original cel is set to sell for £10,000 . 'It is a film that has stood the test of time and is as relevant today as when it was made in 1968. The Band Concert is the most expensive cel sold . The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported £280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference. 'It would be one of the earliest final versions of the Yellow Submarine hand-painted - it really is the holy grail of Yellow Submarine memorabilia. 'Since small stickers were used for when the sub travelled there are not really a great deal of Yellow Submarine cels out there. 'This comes from a former Yellow Submarine ink and paint department employee. 'It is an unusually large image. Colour model cels were used also to help determine the final approved colour scheme of the yellow submarine. 'Colour model cels from this film are very rare, and this is one of the single best cels of the Yellow Submarine we have seen.' The Animation Art Signature Auction will take place in Dallas, Texas on April 9.

A terminally-ill landlord whose dying wish was to marry his partner of 26 years saw their special day descend into farce after a series of blunders. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home. But, instead of having the magical day they had planned, the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly. Guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over, and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather, 54, after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple's special day (pictured) was full of blunders . Guests at the couple's (pictured) wedding were forced to listen to the song 'Wonderful Life' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on, rendering it invalid . Mr Haigh, who died weeks after the ceremony in November last year, was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he'd let her down. In fact, the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House in the city centre, where the pair said their vows. Mrs Haigh, 54, said: 'Geoff was heartbroken by it all. He kept apologising to me and saying he'd wished we'd got married years earlier and done it properly. 'He was devastated, as the way he saw it, this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness.' The couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once Mr Haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal. However, the landlord of The Ram's Head pub, in Oldham, was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely. The pair then settled upon the Manchester venue as it was not too far from their home. It took three people two hours to get Mr Haigh ready for his big day and, determined to make the day perfect for his bride-to-be, he battled through pain to make it to the venue. Mrs Haigh, 54, said every guest at the ceremony -  held in November last year in Manchester  -  wrote a letter of complaint. She has three marriage certificates (pictured) as the first two were riddled with errors . The couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony (pictured) and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date. An amended version posted later was full spelling errors . However, it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began. They said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down. Then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows, which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar. Mrs Haigh, a mother of three, said: 'There was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after I asked I was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day. Geoff Haigh and his wife Heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day. 'It felt like they were merely using us a practice go, like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them.' After the bride and groom said their vows, guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music 'Wonderful Life' while the registrar went out of the room. Unbelievably, almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before Mrs Haigh was compelled to take action. She said: 'Everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on. We couldn't believe it. 'It had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now.' After the ceremony, as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant San Carlos, the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate. They were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected, otherwise their marriage was invalid. Mrs Haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead. However, when the second certificate arrived in the post, it was addressed to Mrs Haigh in her maiden name 'Taylor' and included spelling errors on the document. A third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple. Mr Haigh (above) passed away in January this year, just weeks after his wedding to long-term partner Heather. The couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year . Mrs Haigh (left) said her new husband (right) was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down. She has received £137 from the Manchester register office following the calamity day . Mrs Haigh said: 'It felt like they didn't recognise we were married and that really hurt Geoff before he died. 'It made if feel like the whole thing didn't happen, like it meant nothing at all. It was devastating. 'The guests were all in tears for us. They were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously.' The newlyweds were offered a £137 refund but Mrs Haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough 'loss' to warrant compensation. She said: 'It wasn't about the money, but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband. 'It was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more. They said "we all make mistakes and we are only human". 'That's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man's dying wish and the most special day of our lives, that attitude is not acceptable.' The wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House (pictured)  in the city centre, where the pair said their vows . The family has since received an apology from Manchester City Council, which runs the register office based at Heron House. A spokesman said: 'I'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs Taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations. 'These types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious. They understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding.' However, tragically, Mr Haigh died on January 4 this year before receiving the apology. His wife added: 'Geoff was determined not to die over Christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come, and he didn't want that for us. The energy it took from him to hang on, I couldn't believe.'

Washington (CNN)This week is the 100th anniversary of what many historians acknowledge as the Armenian genocide -- the Turkish massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians . And it's also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word "genocide" to describe the atrocity. It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word "genocide" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a "genocide" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago . In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. "The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence," he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. "We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians . In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. "No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on," she wrote.

Jailed millionaire Robert Durst pleaded not guilty Tuesday to the newest charge against him - a federal charge of possessing a gun after a felony conviction. U.S. District Judge Lance Africk set a trial date for June 22. Durst is an estranged member of the wealthy family that operates 1 World Trade Center. He also faces a murder charge in California and two state weapons charges in Louisiana - one of possessing a .38-caliber revolver after a felony conviction and one of possessing the firearm along with an illegal drug: about 5 ounces of marijuana. Claiming innocence: Suspected murderer Robert Durst appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to a new charge of gun possession. Pictured above leaving federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana in handcuffs after the court appearance . Durst pleaded guilty to two federal charges in Pennsylvania in 2004: possessing a firearm while a fugitive and while under indictment. However, his lawyers say those convictions don't make it illegal for him to carry a gun under Louisiana law. The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of 55-year-old Susan Berman, a longtime friend -allegedly because she was going to talk to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. He was arrested early March 15, less than 12 hours before HBO aired the final segment of 'The Jinx,' in which - off camera in a bathroom but with the microphone still live - Durst whispers, 'There it is. You're caught!' After about 10 other short sentences and disjointed phrases, he says, 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' Durst was arrested last month on suspicion of the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. The two pictured together above . It's believed that Durst killed Berman because she was about to speak to investigators about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife Kathleen McCormack. Pictured together above . Tuesday's hearing had its own bizarre moment when prosecutor Mike McMahon asked Durst if he understood the maximum penalties he faced if convicted. Durst responded: 'And you are?' Durst's attorney and the judge then explained to him who McMahon was. Durst is being held without bail in a state prison where the Orleans Parish mental ward is located, because the sheriff's office says experts found him a suicide risk. Defense attorneys and prosecutors met with a different federal judge last week to discuss another federal matter: whether two FBI agents and a state trooper on an FBI task force should be held in contempt of court for failing to show up at a hearing last week before the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court magistrate. Federal prosecutors moved that part of the case to federal court Monday; Durst's attorneys have not filed their response and have said they would not comment until they do. Durst's lawyers say his arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the conclusion of 'The Jinx.' Durst had registered at the Marriott under the name Everette Ward and was lying low while HBO aired the final chapter of his life story. Authorities said they found a passport, a head-and-chest latex mask, a handgun and marijuana in his room. His lawyers say it was searched illegally.

A Montana judge who was censured by the state's high court for his comments about a 14-year-old rape victim has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that former state District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors. Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher. Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. At Rambold's August 2013 sentencing, Baugh said Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold, the Billings Gazette reported at the time. Baugh, per the newspaper, described the teenage girl as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth. Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. Scroll down for video . Selected: Former District Judge G. Todd Baugh has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. He sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that a 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher . Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence. Legal case: Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez (right) shared some responsibility for her rape by teacher Stacey Rambold (left) Baugh, who served almost 30 years as a state judge, stepped down last year after being censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days. He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he didn't know who nominated him for the achievement award. He also repeated his assertion that media reports about the rape case had not told the whole story. 'I'm not trying to say I didn't make any mistakes. If you go into all the mistakes that were made, it would give a better-balanced report,' Baugh said. Fehr said Baugh had been nominated for the award by members of the bar association, but she declined to say who that was or why he was chosen. Case: Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence . Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. Baugh later apologized for his remarks. He was also censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days . Marian Bradley, Northwest regional director for the National Organization for Women, said the award was inappropriate given Baugh's conduct on the bench. Regardless of his prior accomplishments, Bradley said the Rambold case cannot be overlooked. 'The last chapter in his career, he put himself out there and did not protect a young girl and did not protect a community,' Bradley said. 'Giving him a lifetime achievement award is going to send people into tailspins.' Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. In December, state District Judge Russell Fagg wrote in a column for the Billings Gazette that Baugh handled more than 30,000 cases in his career. 'He has made thousands of good calls, and a few bad calls, as have all of us,' Fagg wrote. 'Bottom line: Baugh is a wonderful person.'

Kelly Ripa has been grief stricken following the sad news that her friend, cosmetic surgeon Dr Fredric Brandt, was found dead by suicide at his Miami mansion on Sunday. So it's understandable that 44-year-old TV star was looking morose as she left her New York City apartment on Tuesday. The Live With Kelly & Michael co-host, who is usually seen smiling, wore a frown as she left the building alone. When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life.' Sad day: Kelly Ripa looked to be in mourning on Tuesday as she left her NYC apartment; on Sunday it was announced her surgeon friend Dr Fredric Brandt had died . The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice.' The former soap opera actress was dressed casually in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on. The beauty was carrying her coat as well as some papers, a cell phone and her purse. Casual look: The former soap opera actress was dressed down in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on . Feeling the pain: On her show Live With Kelly & Michael, the host told Michael Strahan that she will miss the doctor who had worked on the morning program . Near tears: When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life' Heartfelt: The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice' The day before the New Yorker tweeted her condolences for Dr Brandt, 65, who was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry.  Madonna and Stephanie Seymour were clients. 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer,' the star wrote. Her husband Mark Consuelos, retweeted choreographer Isaac Calpito's post, which read: 'Devastated over the loss of our dear friend @drfredricbrandt. You are missed. You are loved. The world has lost one of its kindest souls.' They were close: Dr  Brandt was remembered by  Ripa (left with the surgeon in 2011) in a tweet on Monday following his tragic suicide at his Miami home on Sunday . Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.' The City of Miami Police Department confirmed that Dr Brandt's death on Sunday was a suicide by hanging. An autopsy was scheduled on Monday, the coroner confirmed. Miami Herald columnist, Lesley Abravanel had said Brandt had been 'devastated' recently over rumors comparing him to a character on the Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Her note: The 44-year-old beauty's tweet said, 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer' Abravanel, a Miami Herald columnist, posted a series of tweets on Sunday claiming that he had been 'devastated' by unflattering comparisons to Dr Franff on the  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, according to  sources close to the doctor. The doctor's longtime publicist Jacquie Tractenberg told The New York Post on Monday: 'The show definitely deeply hurt him, he was being made fun of because of the way he looks. 'It is mean, and it was bullying. But the show was not the reason for his depression, and it was not the reason he would take his own life.' The Tractenberg & Co PR agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. Was he bullied?: Dr  Brandt (left) has a resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly 'devastated' by the portrayal . His colleague, Dr Robert Anolik, who worked with Brandt at his practice, posted a moving tribute on Monday. The acclaimed dermatologist wrote: 'Dr. Fredric Brandt died yesterday. For nearly 5 years, Fred and I worked side by side. He was far more than a colleague to me. He was a close friend. I will miss him every day.' The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami by his housekeeper where he lived alone. She called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. The New York Post also wrote a column last month comparing the real-life doctor to the fictional doctor on Tina Fey's hit comedy. 'Sources: Dr Fredric Brandt was "devastated" over comparisons to the protagonist on Tina Fey’s new Netflix show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt",' Abravanel tweeted. Behar tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed' An eye for art: Dr Brandt, a cosmetic dermatologist and well-known art collector pictured in front of a piece from his collection at his apartment in New York City on March 7, 2014 . Dr Franff only appears in one episode, titled 'Kimmy Goes To The Doctor!', of the first season. The character shares Dr Brandt’s smooth skin, platinum blond hair and enthusiasm for plastic surgery, but his door sign claims he’s a ‘board certified D, DS, DDSOBGYN’, rather than a cosmetic dermatologist. The Dr Franff character is depicted on the Netflix show with a high-pitched laugh and unable to speak certain words due to his plastic surgery. He is also seen drinking  from a surgical bag and reinflates his own face after being punched. Netflix had no comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy.

Moscow (CNN)A Russian TV channel aired Hillary Clinton's first campaign video with a rating stamp that means it's for mature audiences, because of fears it might run afoul of the country's anti-gay propaganda law. A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. "There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't," a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. "Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video)." Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, "I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about." The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that "gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights." Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as "a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia." Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. "I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them," Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). "We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone," he said before the 2014 Games. "That's why you can feel safe and free here," he added, "but please leave our children in peace." The rights group ILGA-Europe said in a May 2014 report that Russia was the worst place in Europe (out of 49 countries) for LGBTI people to live.

Manheim Borough Police Chief Joseph Stauffer told Lancaster Online that the vehicle left the road, flipped over and landed upside-down in a ditch. It was not immediately known who was driving or if the couple had worn seat belts. The top was down when the wreck occurred. Stauffer says there's evidence the vehicle started to skid at a slight left turn, then went off the road and hit an embankment near a barn. The vehicle had been rebuilt or restored, with new elements. 'There are no indicators of what caused the accident yet,' said Stauffer. The investigation continues and Manheim police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

(CNN)A French-language global television network regained control of one of its 11 channels Thursday after a cyberattack a day earlier crippled its broadcasts and social media accounts. Television network TV5Monde was gradually regaining control of its channels and social media outlets after suffering what the network's director called an "extremely powerful cyberattack." In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. On a mobile site, which was still active, the network said it was "hacked by an Islamist group." ISIS logos and markings appeared on  TV5Monde social media accounts. But there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group. As day broke Thursday in Europe, the network had regained the use of one of its 11 channels and its Facebook page, Paul Germain, the chain's editor in chief, told BFMTV, a CNN affiliate in France. However, by late morning, a number of pages on the network's website had messages saying they were under maintenance. The outage began around 8:45 p.m. Paris time (2:45 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. TV5Monde offers round-the-clock entertainment and news programming that reaches 260 million homes worldwide, according to the Ministry of Culture and Communications. It functions under a partnership among the governments of France, Canada and Switzerland, as well as the Wallonia-Brussels Federation. Other networks that provide content to TV5Monde include CNN affiliates France 2 and France 3, France 24 and Radio France International.

A singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner. Captured in a front room in Bahama, North Carolina, the three dogs – a Husky called Sky, a brown and white Springer Spaniel called Sadie and a black and white Springer Spaniel called Marshall – take their positions on their make-shift stage. Getting the tune underway, Sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on Sky’s ear as if whispering something – Sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction. The video begins with Sadie the Springer Spaniel barking and interacting with the Husky named Sky . The Springer Spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the Husky joins it, but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl. Following the Husky’s lead, the Spring Spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another. Meanwhile the other Springer Spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner. No, it's like this! The Husky begins howling, causing the Springer Spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead . All together now! The three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony . Before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl, which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo. The trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder. The howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs – who continue to wag their tails – showing any signs of letting up. No encore? The owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise . Eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying: ‘Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.’ And the three dogs, rather put out about being interrupted, stopping and turning to look at him in surprise.

Former Holland forward Dirk Kuyt is returning to Feyenoord next season, aiming to end his professional playing days at the club that was a launching pad for nine years at Liverpool and Fenerbahce, the Rotterdam club announced Friday. Kuyt signed a one-year contract with Feyenoord, who are currently third in the top-flight Eredivisie, but said his stay will likely be longer. Kuyt grew into a favorite among Feyenoord's fanatical fans during his first stint with the club from 2003-2006, after transferring from Utrecht. He was the Eredivisie's top scorer in the 2004-2005 season and was named Dutch footballer of the year in 2006. Dirk Kuyt (left) is returning to Feyenoord, nine years after leaving the Dutch Eredivsie club for Liverpool . Kuyt retired from international football in October after finishing third with the Netherlands at last year's World Cup - a tournament where he underscored his versatility by playing on the wing and at left back. He made 104 appearances for the Netherlands and scored 24 goals. He also was part of the team that finished second in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, losing to Spain in the final. The 34-year-old said now is a good time to return to Rotterdam as "I'm fit and have a great drive to make a success of my time at De Kuip," Feyenoord's stadium. Feyenoord director Martin van Geel said that although Kuyt signed only a one-year deal both he and the club intend his stay in Rotterdam to be longer. "Dirk can keep going for years," Van Geel said. "As far as he's concerned, he can become the Ryan Giggs of Feyenoord and we will add many more years. This will be music to the ears of all Feyenoord fans." The forward has had a successful career for Liverpool, Fenerbache and playing for his country .

While it might be the nation's largest grocer, Walmart Supercenter was ranked at the bottom of the barrel  in a recent survey of America's supermarkets. The retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in Consumer Reports' annual survey, and this year it was rated number 67, the second worst supermarket. As it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine, Walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce. However, it was noted for its better-than-average prices. Walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in Consumer Reports' annual supermarket survey . The retailer (above a worker in the produce section of a Walmart in Miama) came in at number 67 followed by chain Waldbaum's, which was in last place . 'Every store I go in has room to improve,' said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a statement that the company released to Consumer Reports. 'I can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better. 'And if we nail those, one store at a time, our short-term performance gets better.' The respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness, food quality, freshness and staff courtesy. Walmart was joined by A&P (rated number 66) and Waldbaum's (number 68), which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed, according to CBS. The annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts, which was cited by a quarter of respondents. Other findings included: . Source: Consumer Reports . America's favorite supermarket, taking first place, is New York-based Wegmans. The retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness, baked goods and overall shopping experience. Publix came in second place followed by Trader Joe's, Fareway Stores and Market Basket. Wegmans was also among a total of three grocers, including Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, that earned outstanding produce scores. 'It's going to sound cliché, but our employees are our secret sauce,' Jo Natale, Wegmans' vice president of media relations told Consumer Report. Natale also shed light on the fact that Wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded, which 'allows us to take a long-range view, invest in people, and grow at a controlled rate.' While only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely  satisfied with the quality of their store's produce, meat and poultry offerings; nationwide, Consumer Reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings. Findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including Wegmans, Publix, Costco, Whole Foods and Fresh Market were considered standouts in this category. So as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $5,400 on food, what makes a supermarket the best? The survey noted that those who were the 'freshest' stores were usually the best  overall. Wegmans (file photo above) was rated America's favorite supermarket followed by Publix, Trader Joe's and Fareway Stores . In the past, check out speed and low prices might have satisfied customers, but the survey said they are now also demanding a wider variety of healthy, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. They also want more organics and local produce. 'There's a growing rejection of overly processed and packaged foods, especially among younger consumers,' says Willard Bishop's Jim Hertel.

The new survey found women typically take and delete five pictures before they decide they like a selfie . UKIP leader Nigel Farage poses with some young voters while out canvasing in Broadstairs. The survey, carried out by OnePoll, found men are also guilty of taking multiple selfies before they post one they like . Two in three women (64 per cent) feel anxious just having their photo taken, while looking at snaps on social media made 41 per cent feel bad about themselves, according to a survey of 5,000 people by market researchers OnePoll.

A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, "Wow!"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.

(CNN)Thinking about presidential candidates?  Apparently, hormones are a major factor one should consider. According to one female businesswoman in Texas, Hillary Clinton shouldn't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she'll start an unnecessary war. When George W. Bush waged an unnecessary war in Iraq -- was his testosterone to blame? As Cheryl Rios, the CEO of Go Ape Marketing, sees it: "We're built differently, we have different hormones. In the world that we live in, I understand that there's equal rights and that's a wonderful thing and I support all of that. I don't support a woman being president." "With the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war," Rios wrote in a Facebook post. If Rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the Oval Office, she'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president. Throughout history, male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders' decision-making. Studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts. If science doesn't convince you, just Google "cheating politicians" for the long and sordid list of men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Sanford and John Edwards, whose hormones got the best of them. Rios has taken a lot of flak for her "biblically" inspired beliefs, but she's not the only one who's arguing that a woman's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern. Time magazine declared Hillary Clinton the "perfect" age to be president, because she's a postmenopausal woman who is "biologically primed" to lead. (She also happens to be a former first lady, senator and secretary of state.) I'm not joking. Believe me, I wish I were. No wonder Jon Stewart left "The Daily Show" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing. If discussions about a candidate's hormones are what we have to look forward to, the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed. But underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration: The bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015, a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias. We want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything. And you'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college, graduate school and the work force. But what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability, but a bias in how women and girls are viewed. Unfortunately, Cheryl Rios' view of women is not unique. Some people believe women have "our place" and that place is not at the table. They'll tell your daughter to "go for it" but believe she isn't qualified to fulfill her dreams. In a compelling series about women and work, Wharton School professor Adam Grant and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes. The evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless. It's overt: There are more men on corporate boards named John, Robert, William or James than there are women on boards altogether. The bias is also covert: When students rate their favorite professors, they describe the men as "geniuses" and the women as "nice." The bias is real, yet so many of us are blind to it. Hillary Clinton might not be the perfect candidate, but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the White House a much steeper climb. That's not just a problem for Democrats -- it's a problem for Republicans, Independents, everyone. The fact is, equality benefits everyone. It's better for the bottom line (companies with more women in leadership roles make more money).  It's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier, healthier, and more successful. It's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages.  And it's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results. Our nation, our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men. It's not enough to say to our daughters: "You can be anything you want to be." What we need to say is: "You can be anything you want to be, despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong." Rios said that if Clinton is elected, she is "moving to Canada" because "a female shouldn't be president."  Apparently Rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about Canada: Kim Campbell became the country's first female prime minister in 1993. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Canadians elected their first female prime minister, Kim Campbell.

Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after an evening in which their relegation into Sky Bet League One was marked by pre-match supporters' protests against Karl Oyston. Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation . Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen. 'We got off to a flyer and having got back to 1-1 I'm a little bit disappointed we didn't take anything on a horrible night on a horrible pitch.'

Real Madrid have 48 hours to make a decision on Javier Hernandez as the clock runs down on their first option to buy the Manchester United striker. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Monday that the European champions would take stock of Hernandez's situation at the end of the season. However, under the terms set out by United when they loaned the 26-year-old to Madrid, Thursday April 30 marks the end of the Spanish club's 'exclusivity period' to buy the player. Javier Hernandez is enjoying a fine run of form at Real Madrid - scoring three times in his last two games . Hernandez (centre) returned to training with his Real Madrid team-mates on Tuesday . Hernandez (second left) was all smiles in training, but the 26-year-old faces an uncertain future . From Friday they will no longer have first option and United will field offers of around £10million from West Ham, Southampton and Lazio. The Mexico striker who has scored three goals in his last two games has one year left on contract at Old Trafford, but his latest displays have boosted his valuation. Ancelotti said: 'It is a subject that we will evaluate at the end of the season. What I can say is that I have liked his professionalism during the whole year. He is enjoying his opportunity a lot, he has a high level of professionalism and for a coach to have these type of players that are always ready is very positive.'

(CNN)People magazine has anointed Sandra Bullock the world's most beautiful woman of 2015, the publication revealed on Wednesday. Bullock, 50, joins a long line of actresses to receive the honor, including last year's cover girl, Lupita Nyong'o, and Gwyneth Paltrow in 2013. She seems to be taking it all in stride, calling the whole thing "ridiculous." "Real beauty is quiet. Especially in this town, it's just so hard not to say, 'Oh, I need to look like that,' " she told People. "No, be a good person; be a good mom; do a good job with the lunch; let someone cut in front of you who looks like they're in a bigger hurry. The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying." The cover story focuses on Bullock's home life with her son, Louis, 5, and her efforts to stay healthy and fit past her 40s. "I was putting him to bed and told him that even when I'm old and gray and more wrinkly than I am now, I'll still love him and want to tuck him in," she said. "And he asked why I have wrinkles, and I said, 'Well, I hope some of them are from laughing so much.' And he touched my face and said, 'You're not old, you're just happy.' " The Oscar-winning star of movies including "Gravity," "The Blind Side" and "Crash" said she's happy with who she is. "As long as I'm healthy and strong and I don't let this mind of mine run amok with insecurities about what I am not, I can look in the mirror and like who I see." The selection of Bullock, the oldest woman to receive top honors in the history of the list, is a sign that beauty knows no age, say some. "Great choice! Gorgeous, talented, over 50 and FABULOUS! That's the way it's done!" wrote one fan on People's Facebook page. Also making the "most beautiful" cut this year: Gabrielle Union, Ariana Grande and Laverne Cox. The issue hits newsstands Friday.

When Malia asked her mom about how to park in a public parking lot, the first last admitted she was stumped. 'I barely know now too so I have to check with other sources,' she said. The first lady also discussed a Time magazine article which named Malia and sister Sasha among the 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014.

Tens of thousands of people gathered on the White House South Lawn for the annual Easter egg roll festivities which the president officially started by blowing on a whistle . The first lady — who is celebrating the fifth anniversary of her Let's Move! campaign — also noted that both her teenager daughters are very familiar with the concept of sarcasm. 'When they get a little snarky, I'm like, 'Oh, you sound like your dad!'' Tens of thousands of people gathered on the White House South Lawn on Monday for the annual Easter egg roll festivities. This year's theme is #GimmeFive, which is part of Mrs. Obama's campaign to try to get young people to be more active and lead healthier lives. Monday's events included sports and fitness zones, cooking demonstrations, and of course, the traditional egg roll. The egg roll is one of the longest-standing White House traditions. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling.

President in the house: Obama can be seen to the right of the picture above worshiping on Sunday . The First Family has kicked off this year's Easter celebrations on Sunday with a visit to the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia. Rev Howard-John Wesley had opened the service by welcoming the president, before urging the congregation not to take selfies with him. 'How fitting that on the day we celebrate the rising of our Lord and savior, we also welcome our sitting president,' Wesley said, as the congregation rose to their feet in applause. 'This is not selfie time,' Wesley said jokingly. 'Let the brother worship in the house of God.' Churchgoers traditionally walk around to shake hands and give hugs during the greetings and announcements portion of service, but the pastor encouraged the crowd to stay in their seats and greet only their closest neighbors, as the sanctuary was tightly secured with Secret Service agents. The choir - including women in purple dresses and men sporting purple ties - sang a lively rendition of the hymn 'He Lives,' stirring most of the church, filled to capacity, to clap, sing and sway in praise alongside the upbeat organ keys while ushers collected the tithes and offering. Singalong: The family (pictured in the second row of the congregation) joined in with upbeat hymns . People queued around the block for the service in Alexandria, monitored by federal security officers . The lively pastor based his sermon around a scripture from 1 Corinthians 15 on the life and resurrection of Christ. 'Where do you stand in the resurrection of Christ,' he asked. 'You either believe it or reject it.' Wesley said the sacrifices of Christ allowed the congregation to be forgiven for their own sins. 'He took the pain for me. I owe him my life. I owe him my praise. I owe him my hallelujah,' he said. Appearing on Jimmy Fallon's talk show this week, the first lady revealed that she and her husband will be performing a routine with So You Think You Can Dance contestants on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll. It will be to the tune of Uptown Funk. Michelle said she has been practicing the dance, called Gimme Five!, for over a year in the hope that it will inspire children to exercise. Well wishes: Michelle Obama tweeted this message to her thousands of followers on Sunday morning .

Jane Tipper had been walking her dog Molly when the eight-year-old chased a lamb over a cliff . A Border Terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall after chasing a spring lamb off the edge of  a cliff before spending three days stranded on a remote beach. Dog Molly had been on a walk with owner Jane Tipper and her daughter Hannah in Eype, Dorset, last week when the she fell over the cliff's edge along with the lamb. Molly survived a vertical drop of 100ft then rolled 150ft down a steep slope and coming to rest in gorse near the bottom. Her distraught owners managed to see that the eight-year-old had survived the drop, but had no way of getting down to the beach to get her. A team of ten coastguards arrived on the scene and a winchman was lowered down the cliff face but was unable to find her despite four hours of searching. Ms Tipper, who had been celebrating her 64th birthday, was forced to return home in nearby Charmouth without her beloved dog which she has had since she was a puppy. She contacted the website DogLost which arranged for missing posters to be put up in the area. Three days later, Molly was found in an exhaustive state after walking a mile further along the beach to an area popular with dog walkers. It is unclear what had happened, but luckily, she has come through her ordeal relatively unscathed - but there has been no sign of the lamb since the incident. Ms Tipper said: 'I was with my daughter, it was my birthday and we planned a short walk and lunch in a local cafe but we never got there. The border terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall, including a 100ft vertical drop, in Eype, Dorset, but her owner had no way of reaching her. Coastguards searched thoroughly but were unable to find her . 'Molly's usually very good, she doesn't chase animals. 'She fell about 200ft but the cliff was on a slight slope. I couldn't see her at the bottom but my daughter did so we knew she survived the drop. 'The coastguard winched one of them over the cliff and he went from side to side looking for her but couldn't see her. 'It's rocky there, there's thick patches of gorse and it's extremely dangerous. 'After a couple of hours they said they just couldn't spot her. They were very upset about it.' She added the incident left her 'completely numb'. 'We didn't stop searching at the end of the day,' she said. 'When I got home I phoned as many people as I could think of.' But fortunately, a female dog walker recognised Molly from the lost posters that had been put up in the area on Friday. After Ms Tipper put up missing dog posters, Molly was identified by a dog walker three days after going missing. Pictured right, the cliff face in Dorset where Molly fell . Ms Tipper added: 'The lady was walking her dogs when Molly followed her and sat next to her. She called me and we met up and fortunately it was Molly, I was worried it was going to be someone else's dog. 'Molly was very pleased to see me, especially when I got a gravy bone out of my pocket. 'She wasn't hurt or limping or anything, but she was shattered and spent the rest of the day asleep when we got home. 'I think it's really knocked the stuffing out of her. ' A coastguard spokesman urged dog owners to always keep their pets on lead while walking near the coast.

A video showing a man cracking a giant egg to reveal another fully formed egg inside, may be enough to scramble your brain. YouTube user Elman511 cracked open the over-sized egg that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ While the instance is extremely rare, it’s caused when the hen is in the process of forming an egg in her oviduct and another oocyte – the ovum or egg cell that becomes the yolk of the egg – is released too soon. Scroll down for video . Egg-traordinary: US YouTube user Elman511 cracked open an over-sized egg (shown on the left) that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ In the video, Elman511 cracks the egg, which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. He then cracks the smaller egg, which also has a yolk and white inside. ‘That’s the end of the nesting dolls of egg…an egg inside of an egg… crazy man,’ he said, before noting that the yolks look rich. Egg-citing: In the video, ‘Elman511’ cracks the egg (pictured), which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. The unusual occurrence is down to a counter-peristalsis contraction . This is when a second oocyte (yolk) is released by the hen's ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The unusual occurrence is called a counter-peristalsis contraction. A hen releases an oocyte from her left ovary into her oviduct every 18 to 26 hours, Back Yard Poultry Mag explained. Usually, the oocyte travels down the oviduct, adding layers of the egg until it’s laid through the hen’s vent. But in a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The phenomenon has been mentioned as far back as 1250 AD by the Dominican friar and polymath Albertus Magnus in his book De Animalibus. Ask the egg-spert: In a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. This results in an egg with another made inside it, producing two yolks (pictured)

(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for "lost" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the "holiday" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the "mistake" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the "war on women" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious "war on women" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The "war on women" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the "war on women" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative "solution" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.

Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge . A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman . 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'

An investigation has concluded Freddie Gray broke his neck after falling head-first into the back of the police van as it was moving, it was reported today. Medical and law enforcement sources briefed on the police investigation told ABC News Gray's 'catastrophic' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt 'in the back door of the van'. They claimed there was 'no evidence' Gray sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest, which was caught on camera on a street side on April 12. According to ABC's sources, Gray was standing in the van, bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door. It is believed he fell into the door, breaking his neck. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A report claims Freddie Gray broke his neck when he fell head-first into the back of the van as it was moving . Similar van: Freddie Gray was stood, bent over, with his head facing the back door of a van like this . Timeline? It is believed Gray fell head-first into the back of the van, breaking his neck, during the journey . Inside: The above diagram shows the inside the police van . Pictured: The second stop which police failed to report in their paperwork after the van journey, during which Freddie Gray sustained a 'catastrophic' head injury. It was picked up by a privately-owned security camera . According to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray . The news comes hours after Baltimore Police admitted the van transporting Gray made a previously unreported stop. The mysterious detail was picked up by a privately-owned security camera, and will be integral to the police investigation into Gray's death, which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on Thursday morning. It is not known why the van stopped at the corner of North Fremont Ave and Mosher Street before it made another two stops then finally transported Gray to the hospital. And police have yet to clarify why Gray would have been standing without a seat belt on. Just nine days before his arrest, the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy, making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van. Revelation: Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop. He refused to elaborate on the details of the new information . Police Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to elaborate on the new information. He said the contents of the report, which was completed and handed to the State Attorney at 8.50am Thursday, will remain confidential as they continue to investigate. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested. The report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver, who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators, according to ABC. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton. As the police department, Mayor's office, and state prosecutors refuse to address the development, it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of Gray's arrest more than two weeks ago. A relative of one of the suspended police officers told CNN she believes Gray was injured during his arrest outside the van. Her family member, she said, was based inside the van, and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he 'didn't do'. However, this theory is at odds with the medical examiner's report which allegedly found Gray sustained injuries by falling over inside the van, where he had been placed without a seat belt. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN her family member was in the van with Gray as he screamed and cried for medical help. But she believes the spinal injury which led to Gray's death was inflicted earlier, during his arrest on April 12. In an appeal that echoes Gray's family, she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow. 'Six officers did not injure this man,' she told Don Lemon. Secret stop: This is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stop . These are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stop . Jung Hwang's convenience store's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting Freddie Gray . 'Six officers didn't put him in the hospital. 'I'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did, that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.' Her words came after a police document was leaked to the Washington Post, in which the other prisoner in the transport van with Gray said he could hear the 25-year-old slamming himself against the wall. The prisoner speculated that Gray was trying to hurt himself. In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'. However, he admits he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton . The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family. 'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we've seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' Outrage over the unexplained death of a black man in Baltimore, Maryland prompted nationwide protests against police brutality on Wednesday from Houston to Boston. Baltimore has been the scene of near-nightly protests ever since the April 19 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who is believed to have been fatally injured while in police custody. State Attorney Marilyn Mosby urged the public to be patient as she reviews the information. 'While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,' Mosby said on Thursday. 'We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.' Freddie Gray: The 25-year-old was poisoned by lead paint as a child growing up in Baltimore . Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west side . Nicknamed 'Pepper', he was described by an ex-girlfriend as happy-go-lucky with an infectious sense of humor. The Baltimore police knew him, however, as a 5ft-8ins felon who had notched up at least 18 arrests and a handful of convictions - mainly for Class A drugs but also burglary, assault and illegal gambling. He was said to have set off running at the sight of police patrolling a well known open-air drug market. He was taken into custody for possession of a switchblade and during transport to the station he experienced what officers described as 'a medical emergency'. Gray, who had asthma, requested an inhaler and had trouble breathing in the van, but police didn't provide his inhaler. According to Gray's family his spine was severed 80 per cent at his neck, three vertebrae were fractured and his larynx was injured. Court papers describe Gray's childhood as problematic. He lived with his heroin-addicted disabled mother in a home in Sandtown-Winchester that contained enough poisonous lead in the peeling painted walls and windowsills for a court settlement to conclude that he and his two sisters were incapable of leading normal functioning lives. Lab tests conducted in the 1990s showed that they had levels of lead in their blood nearly double what the state of Maryland defines as the minimum for lead poisoning. In Baltimore, more than 2,600 children have been found to have high levels of lead in their blood, according an annual report released by the Maryland Department of the Environment in 2014. 'This is the toxic legacy of lead-based paint,” Ruth Ann Norton, head of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative and a founding member of the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission, told the Baltimore Sun. 'Our kids are ill equipped to stay in the classroom, finish school. They’re very unlikely to go on to higher education. They’re less likely to be able to hold a job', she said. 'They’re less equipped to be able to overcome the poverty and other circumstances that pull them down. Children with lead poisoning will have defects, regardless of whether their parents are ‘nice’ or not.' Gray lived off the resulting 'lead check' settlement although it is unclear exactly how much he received. Whatever money he did have he was said to spend buying designer accessories. The Sandtown neighborhood is a 72-block neighborhood made up of almost entirely of African Americans. More than one-third of residents live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter are unemployed. The majority of Maryland's state prison population are said to said to hail from Sandtown, according to the Justice Policy Institute.

The two cars ended up in a dead end road and that's when Hermenier parked his car so that the other car could not leave. Hermenier said that's when Delisle allegedly threatened them with a loud piece of machinery. 'It was a terrifying situation,' Hermenier said. Cyr says that in the future if she sees a driver being reckless, she will not follow him, especially if she is with her children. 'Everyone will react differently, but I would like to say that if you see dangerous driving, do not follow the driver — the mistake that we made with two children in the back seat. We regret it tremendously. If it happens to you, pull over and just call police.' Delisle is scheduled to return to court July 7. He was released for the time being and ordered to stay away from the couple’s home and workplace and told not to communicate with them. Conditional release: Delisle released for the time being and ordered to stay away from the couple’s home and workplace and not communicate with them until he returns to court on July 7 .

Screeching around the track in a car he last drove more than 50 years ago, Sir Stirling Moss appears to have lost none of his racing pedigree. And at 85, the man widely seen as history's greatest all-round racer has revealed the unusual daily routine he thanks for his impressive longevity – 77 press-ups and half a bottle of Chardonnay. Sir Stirling, who won 212 races in his 14-year career, also spoke about how he has swapped the high-octane vehicles of his heyday for a tiny electric car that has a top speed of just 50mph. Reunited: Sir Stirling Moss sitting behind the wheel of the refurbished Austin-Healey Sprite . Success: The 85-year-old won 212 races during his 14-year career before a crash at Goodwood in 1962 . Back in action: Sir Stirling examines the refurbished car alongside Car SOS presenter Fuzz Townshend . Speaking to The Daily Mail, Sir Stirling said he sees fitness as a 'way of life' which is why he is still so confident behind the wheel. However, never one for strenuous gym sessions, he puts his health down to more unusual methods. He said: 'I have half a bottle of wine a day, which fits in very nicely, and that's it. I do what I call lady press ups and I do 77 a day. 'It's not as difficult as it sounds because I do them from a kneeling position. I could not do 70 press ups like I could when I was 30 years old. 'I've broken various bones during my career so I'm not that flexible. I think staying fit is a way of life more than anything else really.' When it comes to diet, he said he believes in indulgence and never denies himself something he wants. He said: 'I never go to bed hungry, let's put it that way, especially as Susie is such a fantastic cook. Car SOS sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. Above, Sir Stirling with presenters Fuzz Townshend and Tim Shaw . Sir Stirling drove the refurbished car in 1962 - one month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career (pictured above). He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks . 'I allow myself whatever I want but I would have to say my indulgences are that Susie and I drink one bottle of wine each day, white certainly, Chardonnay. And chocolate. I'm trying to cut that down but not that successfully.' He made the revelations after a new documentary reunited the father-of-two with the Austin-Healey Sprite he used as a training car before the 1962 Sebring three-hour race. The race took place a month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career. He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks. He returned to the cockpit a year later but decided against competing professionally as he felt he was no longer driving instinctively. The Austin-Healey Sprite was also used by the rest of his team, including Hollywood star Steve McQueen and racing legends Innes Ireland and Pedro Rodriguez. Car SOS, which broadcasts on the National Geographic Channel on Thursday, sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. While he found fame hurtling around corners at death-defying speeds, Sir Stirling now takes a more measured approach to the road. For the last 18 months he has been driving a Renault Twizy, an electric car with a top speed of 50mph. He said of the car, which retails for less than £7,000: 'I live right in the middle of London, right by Hyde Park Corner, and the limitations on an electric car like that, you don't notice them. 'If I lived outside the North Circular there might be times when I'd think "Crickey, I wonder if I'll make it back on the charge" but having said that, the Twizy is just the sort of car to have around London. Sir Stirling has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. Above, the couple at Silverstone in July 2011 . 'It is absolutely very different to the cars I used to drive. There are certainly good reasons to have a petrol car but living where I do, in the centre of London, I can't think of anything better than what I have got.' Sir Stirling, who was knighted in 2000, said he would not want to be a professional driver today because he thinks there are too few races. He said: 'It's quite different now though, they only do 18 races a year, I was doing 52 because I would go down to Australasia in the winter or Malaysia or South Africa and do all types of racing. ' It's so different now that you can't compare the life of a driver then and now. It's unfortunately one of those things that has moved on and I don't think will ever be able to move back.' He has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. He added: 'If your wife is your best friend that's the important thing to me. If every decision you think about or make or take you discuss with her first, I think that's very important. 'But then Susie says I do what I want anyway.' Car S.O.S. broadcasts on Thursday April 9 at 8pm on National Geographic Channel.

The police officer accused of murdering Walter Scott will be banned from seeing his first-born child for several months, it was revealed today. Patrol officer Michael Slager will be refused the right to hold the baby which his wife Jamie is set to give birth to in a few weeks. He is only granted video access to his eight and a half month's pregnant wife and an officer stands outside the booth whenever he talks to his family. They are not allowed to spend any time together and contact is via video screens with headphones at the Charleston County jail. But the baby will not be able to enter the South Carolina prison. Before the fall: Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, with his wife Jamie before his arrest. Slager was charged with murder after shooting Walter Scott, 50, after stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina . Visit: Michael Slager received a visit at Charleston County Jail last Friday from his pregnant wife and mom . It is deemed unsafe for an infant to enter the prison so Slager will have to rely on photographs as cell phones and access to the internet is forbidden. He will be informed by a telephone call and have to wait to see photographs, which will be examined by officials before being presented to him. When Jamie attended the jail on Friday, she was made to turn through the prison's reception area and take a seat next to a video screen for a talk with him which lasted around two hours. The booths are protected by screens to prevent onlookers from seeing inmates, but appointments have to made in advance. Relatives of other prisoners queued to use the video booths after registering with prison officials behind thick glass security screens as Jamie and her accused husband talked with the aid of headphones. But their first child together will not be allowed to visit him in prison until jail chiefs decide that the baby's health would not be at risk from being there. Although there is no specific age limit, prison policy is not to allow babies in. No date has yet been set for his first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away. Major Eric Watson of the Charleston County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online: 'He is treated just like any other prisoner, except for being in protective custody. 'His baby won't be coming to the prison and he will not be allowed to see the child. It could be several months before he does. 'His attorney can apply for the baby to be brought to the jail if he wants.' Walter Scott was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen. Family tell says the light was an accessory and both mandatory stop lamps were functioning . Slager, 33, already has two step children from his wife's previous marriage, but the new baby will be the first for him and Jamie. Major Watson said Slager had no access to the internet and was under close scrutiny to deter any threat from angry prisoners over the shooting of Walter,who was gunned down by the officer after being stopped for an apparent faulty tail light on his Mercedes. Walter's supporters and family say he was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen and this was wrong because the light was an accessory and both his obligatory stop lamps were functioning. Major Watson said Slager was being offered three meals a day and recreation time, but was isolated from other inmates. Housed in a room with one small window, he has no interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail. One released prisoner said outside the gates: 'Man, it ain't no holiday being in there. He has to watch his back more than most because of what he did. There's a lot of angry men in there, black and white.' Walter's brother Anthony said police faced 'many questions' about traffic stops based on racial profiling and that his brother's death should serve as a catalyst for a change in police policies. Meanwhile, the man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton. No date has yet been set for Slager's first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away . The mystery man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton . The 30-year-old was detained by police as Walter fled his Mercedes Benz before dying in a hail of bullets and later released. Pierre's family said they had no idea why he was in the car and how he came to be friends with the shooting victim. His grand mother Eunice Fulton, 70, said: 'I spoke with my daughter Franetta on Thursday and Pierre had only just told her he was in the car. 'It was a terrible incident but we haven't had the chance to speak to him about it. He used to live with me until a couple of years ago. But I don't where he hangs out now. He moves around.' Pierre, who was known to police, had stayed in the background since Walter was shot by officer Michael Slager and at the weekend rejected media requests for interviews. He has given a full statement to investigators, but police refused to reveal his name and what he has told them. He had requested privacy. Pierre was caught on the policeman's dash cam after Walter had fled and been shot. But police released him without charge and he was not suspected of any crime. He has convictions for unlawfully carrying a pistol and served 174 days in prison in 2005 and has been arrested several times. His grandmother added: 'He is a good grandson. He cares for his family. But I don't know what he is doing now.' Pierre has worked as a cleaner, laundry man and warehouseman over the years, but some members of his family have lost touch with him. Rosanne Grant of Alternative Staffing employment agency told Daily Mail Online: ' He worked at various jobs over the period of a year through me. The last time I hear about him was in 2006 and nothing since. I don't know what he has been working at.'

The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was ‘no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident’. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had ‘existed for some time prior to the accident’. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell’s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.’

Sunderland are trailing former Wigan striker Franco di Santo. The Argentine is playing for Werder Bremen and has scored 13 goals in 22 games this season. The Bundesliga side want £8million for the 26-year-old who Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton knows well from his time at Chelsea. Sunderland are considering a summer move for in-form Werder Bremen forward Franco Di Santo . The Argentine has been in superb form for his club this season, netting 13 goals in 22 games . Di Santo began his senior career with Chilean side Audax Italiano in 2006, before catching the Blues' eye two years later. However, he failed to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and following a similarly ineffectual loan spell at Blackburn Rovers, was sold to Wigan in 2010. He spent three seasons with the Lancashire-based outfit, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances. Di Santo was an unused substitute during the club's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2013, before being released at the end of that season. He made the move to the Bundesliga in August 2013 and has appeared to fulfil some of his early promise. Di Santo previously played for Chelsea but struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and was sold . Di Santo played for Wigan for three seasons, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances before being released .

(CNN)Roseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: "My vision is closing in now," she said. "I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up." Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making . Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) "It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of," explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. "Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision," Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy . Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk . Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . Eat your greens . Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries . Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke . While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.

Eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements, a study has claimed. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.

Jessica Silva has spoken about why she had to kill her abusive husband and revealed she hopes his family can one day forgive her for what she did. In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' On Sunday night, Jessica Silva speaks publicly for the first time about the day, Mother’s Day 2012, when she stabbed and killed her partner, the father of her young son. Last month she walked free from court, despite being convicted of manslaughter, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all. Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica’s parents). He revealed to Michael Usher that the ordeal had so destroyed Jessica that 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I didn't recognise her' Jessica Silva admits she was living in fear and violence and she told no one. 'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' 'During the interview she gets to the point where she reveals "my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness". 'I don't know if there will ever be a neat ending. 'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, "you're fat, you're ugly", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . 'On that fateful night, Jessica made a split-second decision to save herself and her family,' according to the 60 Minutes program. 'Jessica opens up about her life with Polkinghorne and recounts what happened the night that ended in his death.' 'I didn't realise that she was going to be as raw as she still was,' Usher added. 'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how "I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.' See the full story on 60 Minutes at 8.30pm on Nine tonight .

(CNN)A 32-year-old Massachusetts man is facing murder charges, authorities said Wednesday, four days after another man's remains were found in a duffel bag. The Middlesex District Attorney's Office said that Carlos Colina, 32, will be arraigned the morning of April 14 for murder in connection with the remains discovered Saturday in Cambridge. Earlier this week, Colina was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. A Middlesex County judge then revoked bail for Colina in another case he's involved in, for alleged assault and battery. The victim in that case is different from the one whose remains were found in recent days. Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. "This was a gruesome discovery," District Attorney Marian Ryan said. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.

Fired: Major General James Post III was fired on Friday after making a treason comment . An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane. A-10 retirement: The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the A-10,  low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support . The inspector general's investigation interviewed several witnesses who remembered Post using the word 'treason' to describe efforts to oppose the Air Force leadership's decision to retire the plane, either via a social media campaign or by talking to Congress. In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.' General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander. Post issued an apology on Friday and said he did not intend to try to prevent people from talking to lawmakers. Handed in a latter: General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander .

Ukip candidate Kim Rose (pictured handing out sausage rolls today) is being investigated by police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls . A Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event, which also saw veteran snooker player White play pool with local youngsters. Mr Rose, a jeweller, said he was oblivious until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. Laughing off the allegations, he said: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes. 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties. 'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 'He said, "it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.' Mr Rose, who will now have to report to a police station on Monday, added: 'It was a fantastic day. We laid on teas, coffees, sandwiches and some sausage rolls. 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.' Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right) branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll' Today Mr Rose was seen out in Southampton handing out sausage rolls to members of the public . He said: 'The Ukip support is very strong here and I feel the main political parties will do anything they can to scrutinise everything about us.' Mr Rose added that if other politicians fear voters could be 'bribed with sausage rolls', perhaps it is not surprising they will not trust the country with a referendum on EU membership. Today the parliamentary candidate was out campaigning on the streets of Southampton, handing out sausage rolls to members of the public. Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, backing Mr Rose. He said: 'I think it’s utter nonsense. There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions. 'Having a few sausage rolls I don’t really think counts as one of those.' Mr Rose said the event, which was attended by 250 people, took place at a community centre in Southampton on February 21 - more than a month before Parliament was officially dissolved. He invited veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, who he described as a long-time friend. The former world number two and six-time World Champion, nicknamed 'The Whirlwind', played pool with residents, who were charged £2 to attend the event. 'I've known Jimmy as a friend for a number of years and so I asked him to come down and play pool with the kids,' Mr Rose said. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. 'I didn't want to make the event very Ukip so we put all the party banners away and everybody had a game of pool with Jimmy.' The Electoral Commission said the pastry provision was a police matter. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We have a received an allegation of "treating" by a prospective parliamentary candidate, contrary to the Representation of the People Act 1983. We are looking into the complaint. No arrests have been made.' Electoral Commission rules on treating state: 'A person is guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting. 'Treating requires a corrupt intent - it does not apply to ordinary hospitality.' Anyone found guilty of treating can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. Mr Rose has been a member of Ukip since 1999. He briefly stood as an independent in the key marginal Southampton Itchen seat in 2010 before pulling out. He is campaigning on tackling deprivation in Southampton, as well as wanting to pull the UK out of the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron came under criticism in the constituency earlier this week after sending a letter to residents spelling the constituency's name wrong three times. His letter, which has his letterhead and signature, had 'Itchen' spelled as 'Itchin', prompting the Conservatives to apologise for the embarrassing mistake. The constituency's MP has been Labour's John Denham since 1992. He held the seat in 2010 by just 192 votes and is standing down after May 7.

A husband was left so traumatised by his wife's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock, despite his wife already being given a hefty payout. In a case which could have huge financial consequences for the NHS, Julie Ronayne was awarded £160,000 after she was left 'looking like Michelin man' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008. Her husband Edward, who lives with Mrs Ronayne in Netherley, Liverpool, was awarded £9,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife's appearance. Edward Ronayne was given £9,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up 'like Michelin man' after botched surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital (pictured) The severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis, which the woman had contracted during the surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation. The test case, being heard at London's Appeal Court, could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an NHS mishap. Mr Ronayne was awarded the damages from Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust in July 2013. Liverpool County Court heard how he had been a 'secondary victim' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife's new appearance. He had described her 'colloquially as looking like a Michelin man', the court heard. Mr Ronayne also described his wife's first two days in hospital as 'the worst days of my entire life'. He said he had been 'brought up not to complain' but had never fully recovered from the sight. He added that he had been left feeling tearful, overwhelmed, angry and powerless. The judge, who described him as 'an honest and reliable witness', said: 'His symptoms...were pathological and went beyond simply the distress and anger that a man would suffer due to the near terminal illness of his wife.' But in the appeal court today, Charles Cory-Wright QC, who represents the health trust, told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury. He said Mr Ronayne's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims, costing the cash-strapped NHS millions in compensation. The barrister argued that Mr Ronayne would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation. He added that he was visiting his wife in hospital and therefore would have expected her to look unwell. He told the court: 'Hospitals on a day-to-day basis deal with people who are ill or vulnerable. They go there followed by their loved ones. It is unfortunately a matter of day-to-day occurrence that great emotional responses will take place in a hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if Mr Ronayne is allowed to keep the money. The test case is being heard at the appeal court . 'The question arises more and more often in cases like this as to whether those relatives have a claim.' Stressing the importance of the appeal, he told the judges: 'This appeal is not just about this case, but the concerns NHS Trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place. Peritonitis is caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the stomach. It is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, which can rapidly spread around the body. Peritonitis requires immediate treatment and is a medical emergency. Most cases of peritonitis are the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix or digestive disorders. Peritonitis can be fatal and needs to be treated quickly to avoid such complications. Source: NHS . 'The effect of this judgement, if it stands, is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases, as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock. 'Often emotional illness follows, but there is not the necessary element of shock. There needs to be a suddenly shocking event which, because of its shocking nature, causes that psychiatric illness. That is often lost in the wash in these cases.' But Lord Justice Sullivan said the incident had no doubt been 'shocking' 'Simply going into hospital and seeing one's loved ones and family looking peaky is not enough,' he said. 'But to see one's wife looking like the Michelin man is shocking.' Mr Cory-Wright then replied: 'If you saw your loved one looking like the Michelin man, swollen and all that, it would be shocking in an ordinary sense. 'But it would not be shocking in the sense of being suddenly overwhelmed so as to lead to psychiatric injury.' The judges recognised the importance of the case by reserving their decision on the trust's appeal until a later date. The case was heard in front of Lord Justice Sullivan, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Beatson. Mrs Ronayne went on to make a good recovery.

John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United with thousands of supporters planning to boycott Sunday's home match against Spurs. The 50-year-old has found himself the target of angry fans who are disillusioned with Mike Ashley’s running of the club. Results on the pitch – they have lost five on the spin - have not helped Carver’s cause, but the problems at Newcastle run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad. John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United . United’s supporters will protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from billionaire Ashley, especially as the Magpies have returned record profits of £18.7million and this week revealed they also have £34m sat in a bank account. Carver is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer – or deflect – questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis, distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul. But as reported by Sportsmail last month, senior sources within St James’ Park have indicated that Derby boss Steve McClaren will take over in the summer, regardless of whether or not the Rams are promoted from the Championship. On Tyneside, however, he will inherit what Carver believes is the toughest task in the land: ‘I think it is the hardest job in football, definitely,’ he said. Steve McClaren has already been tipped as a replacement for Carver should he face the Newcastle axe . ‘For me, this is the dream job, but you love it and hate it at the same time. ‘The hardest thing is taking the criticism off your own people. Some of it is deserved and some of it is not. ‘Sometimes you’re dealt the hand and you’ve got to get on with it and this is the hand I’ve been dealt. ‘When I took it on, if I hadn’t accepted then I would have been kicking myself. ‘And I’ve said this before, I genuinely believe that if I’ve got the right tools I can do the job. ‘But it is bitter sweet at the moment. This job is definitely a rollercoaster.’ Website AshleyOut.com are co-ordinating Sunday's planned boycott. They will protest outside of the Gallowgate End before kick-off and after the game. During the match they will go to Leazes Park behind the stadium. Carver, though, has urged fans to get behind the team. Fans are unhappy at how Newcastle are being run under Mike Ashley and have planned a boycott . ‘I would go to the match because I support the team,’ said Carver when asked if he would stay away as a supporter. ‘I think they (boycotters) do support the team but they have obviously got their own issues. I respect those issues. ‘I never thought I'd see this to be perfectly honest, especially in the North East of England because we love football. ‘So obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come, and I respect that.’ Carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against Tottenham Hotspur .

This is the moment when a not-so-little baby elephant seal emerged from the sea to give a surprised tourist one big cuddle. Charlene Fritz, 35, was visiting  Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula as part of an expedition when she made an unusual friend on the beach. Despite being no more than two months old, the elephant seal pup is still thought to have weighed around 200lbs, and Ms Fritz had a struggle sitting upright. Scroll down for video . One big cuddle: The elephant seal is thought to have been no more than two months old, but at a whopping 200lbs, Canadian tourist Charlene Fritz still struggled to reciprocate the hug . Making friends: Ms Fritz had the surprise of a lifetime when the baby elephant seal came out of the water for a cuddle during an expedition to Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula . Will you be my mummy? Elephant seal pups are abandoned by their mothers at just one month to learn how to take care of themselves . Charlene, from Saskatchewan, Canada, said: 'The seal climbed on top of me without hesitation. We shared a very sweet moment in time I will never forget. 'Her mouth was all pink inside and her eyes were amazing to look into. Like the deepest depths of the sea. I could have stared into her eyes forever.' She added: 'It was made very clear to me that I was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her. 'She came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up. I wanted to hug her so badly. 'Physically she felt like a big dough ball, super warm and like she had no bones. She did not smell of fish or have bad breath. She had never even eaten a fish at that point in her life. Rules: Ms Fritz explains that she badly wanted to hug the baby seal, but that regulations on the Antarctic expedition dictated that she in no way touch the pup . 'Sweet moment in time': Ms Fritz described the seal pup's eyes as being 'like the deepest depths of the sea' Crushing: Ms Fritz struggles to sit upright under the weight of the 200lbs baby elephant seal . Two young elephant selas have a rest on the shore of Snow Hill Island, Antarctic Peninsula . Charlene, whose 2011 encounter with the seal was filmed by a friend, had at first wondered why the seal was so friendly but later learned about the harsh weaning process. She said: 'Basically the mother fattens them up with her milk for a month or so, then abandons them on the beach. 'They have never been in the ocean to learn to fish or anything and basically lay there starving until they figure out to take the leap of faith and go into the sea. 'This is why they can be so sweet and looking for love, I guess.' However, an encounter with a full-grown elephant would have been a different prospect. Males of the species can weigh up to two tonnes and are known to have a nasty temper during mating season as the battle to control harems of females.

(CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are "conscientious objectors," and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new "no jab, no pay" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. "The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments," said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. "It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing," Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.

Many people might think that trust issues, long distances and cheating scandals are the biggest strains on a relationship. But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.

James Bond would have lasted just seven minutes into his last movie Skyfall before succumbing to fatal wounds from a uranium shot if the secret agent played by Daniel Craig was real. A group of medical experts watched the 23rd outing for Ian Fleming's hero and concluded that Bond would have been unlikely to survive to the end of the two hour film, and would have died or been critically injured several times . Within the first seven minutes, Bond is hit by a depleted uranium shell - an armour-piercing round normally used to destroy tanks that would almost certainly have killed the hero. Scroll down for video . James Bond would have died minutes into Skyfall - after being hit by a depleted uranium shell and then falling from a speeding train, where he could easily have severed his spine . As Bond fights in an icy loch he would have been likely to have died from the cold or lack of oxygen . In a feature for Total Film, the medical experts examine several different action movies to see whether the man characters would have survived their ordeal. Other movies to undergo the medical assessment were Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis. Unsurprisingly John McClane would not have survived. According to the experts, Bond's depleted uranium wound would have been fatal as it 'would have turned his lungs inside out and killed him'. In the unlikely event the massive round did not cause catastrophic injuries, the radioactive nature of the ammunition 'would greatly increase his cancer risk'. Bond cheats death throughout the two hour film, including when he is locked in a gunfight on the streets of Istanbul as he attempts to chase villain Patrice for a hard drive containing details of undercover agents . The hero effortlessly performs surgery on himself, but would have been likely to have lost too much blood . Not that growing old gracefully was ever likely for James Bond, who at one stage performs surgery on himself to remove a bullet, where he 'risks blood loss, lack of consciousness, nerve and muscle damage'. He also faces a significant risk of infection. Even jumping from the roof of a speeding train into a river presents its own risks, which probably should not be tried by ordinary members of the public as he would likely 'sever his spinal cord or break his neck'. 7 mins - Bond is shot in the chest by a depleted uranium bullet, likely to kill. If he had survived this the radioactive qualities of the ammunition would have increased his risk of cancer. 12 mins - The action hero is shot and then jumps from the roof of a speeding train into a river. The height of this fall would be likely to break his neck. 31 mins - After being shot Bond bravely removes a bullet from his shoulder. This DIY surgery would have led to significant blood loss as well as damaged his nerves and muscles. 2hrs - Bond fights in an icy loch. While the temperature alone would have presented problems, fighting underwater would have significantly depleted Bond's oxygen supply and could have caused him to drown. While James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 has survived since 1960, it is unlikely the man himself would have . However, filming the movie can prove slightly dangerous as Daniel Craig has recently required knee surgery after hurting himself while performing a stunt in his final Bond movie Spectre. Even Home Alone would have produced three fatalities. Marv and Harry would have likely died within hours of the movie's end while Kevin would have been killed within the first third of the film after falling from some shelves. However, Tom Hanks in Cast Away could have plausibly survived on a desert island for four years - as long as he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash. Although according to the experts, 76 per cent of the time he would have died in the accident. While Bruce WIllis' character in Die Hard, John McClane, pictured, would not have made it to the fourth movie . Tom Hanks in Castaway could have survived on the island - in the unlikely event he escaped the aircraft .

Need to have a difficult conversation with your other half or your boss? It might be a good idea to take them out to dinner. We get on better with each other over a meal, according to researchers who said it makes everyone from work colleagues to children seem more pleasant. Dutch and Canadian scientists asked nearly 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent at least five minutes talking to someone else. Well digested: Scientists have found people felt happier and more relaxed while eating at home or at work . About a fifth of the 1,000 meetings recorded took place over a meal, the journal Physiology and Behavior reports. On these occasions participants felt happier and more relaxed, whether at home, at work or elsewhere. They felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments and were more likely to make compromises. They also believed that the person they were with was warmer and more likeable. And hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. One possible explanation is that chewing raises levels of the ‘feel-good’ brain chemical serotonin. Food for thought: The study found that people can talk about tricky subjects far easier over a meal . It is also possible that shared meals enhance our inbuilt desire to be accepted and to please others. Marije aan het Rot, of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, said that tricky topics might be best tackled over a meal. Bosses and employees and also parents and children, might all find it easier to get on at the table while dinner may not be the best idea for a first date. Dr Rot said the people in her study knew each other and the effect of a sharing a meal might be different among strangers. Apart from anything else, meals can be lengthy and people meeting for the first time might struggle to come up with enough conversation.

Have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door, been woken by a Facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger? To deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies, one company has designed a range of prototype products. You can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product, funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Scroll down for video . Leeds-based Direct Line is running a competition called #EverydayFix. They asked groups to design products to deal with common problems. These include forgetting to lock the door, which one company hopes to solve with their Forget Me Lock prototype, shown . The products were designed as part of the Direct Line Everyday Fix design makeathon. They asked people to pick their top ten ‘everyday emergencies’ - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives. Groups from London-based design company Makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist. 1. Not being able to sleep (46 per cent*) 2. Losing your keys (37 per cent) 3. Being stuck in traffic when already late (35 per cent) 4. Losing an important paper or document (33 per cent) 5. Nowhere to park (32 per cent) 6. Printer not working when you need to print something (31 per cent) 7. Running out of battery on your phone whilst out (31 per cent) 8. Discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo (30 per cent) 9. Dealing with machine operated customer service (26 per cent) 10. Forgetting your bank card when paying for an item (25 per cent) *How many people thought this was a problem . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called ‘Snooze’, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep. To deal with not remembering if you had locked your door, ONN Studio created the Forget Me Lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door. It fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. This means that even when out or about, you can find out if your door is locked or not. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost. Direct Line is running a competition on Twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about Snooze, Forget Me Lock or Nipper. The Forget Me Lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key. When the key is turned in a lock it swivels green  to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost . The Nipper device (shown) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called Snooze, shown, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep . Whichever tweet has the most retweets, with the #EverydayFix hashtag, by 23 April will go into a Kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development. ‘We’ve seen the great British designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies,’ said Paul Smyth, co-founder of Makerversity. ‘Through the Direct Line Everyday Fix event, we’ve been able to extend our role as "fixers" and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation’s everyday emergencies,’ added John Shaw, head of R&D and Innovation at Direct Line. Of the products that didn’t make the cut, one was a helmet with ‘bone conduction headphones’ that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you. Another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space, which would then alert you when the space was free, if you couldn’t find somewhere to park. And as another solution to your phone running out of battery, one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies. Products that didn't make the final shortlist included the Parking Pin, shown. You could leave this in a parking space, and it will alert you when the space is free, so you can park your car . The Relay app, shown, would let you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies . And the 'Hat Nav' was a smart helmet that used ‘bone conduction headphones’ to give you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .

A cancer survivor who had to have part of his mouth removed after a tumour stopped him from swallowing has been given a new tongue made out of part of his arm. David Billing, 48, has told how he had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital, during which surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue. Medics then replaced the lost tissue with muscle from Mr Billing's arm. The only drawback is that it still has hairs on it, and he now has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved. David Billing, 48, had to have part of his tongue removed after being diagnosed with mouth cancer, so doctors made him a new one out of skin from his arm - which still has hairs on it . The dramatic story began after Mr Billing, a part-time welder, went to his GP in October 2013 after being unable to swallow. After a second doctor's appointment, he was referred to Royal Derby where specialists discovered an ulcer on the right-hand side of his tongue and confirmed it was cancer after a biopsy. He said: 'Being told I had cancer was mind-blowing and a real low point for me. I had no idea when they found this ulcer in my mouth that this was what it would be.' It was a double-blow for Mr Billing, as he had been made redundant just a week before from his job at digger manufacturer JCB. He said: 'It was all so overwhelming. My life and everything was ticking along nicely and the next thing I knew I'd lost my job and needed to have a major operation.' David had the procedure to remove the lump and rebuild his tongue on November 13, 2013. He said: 'I had to have a stomach tube fitted first and then go through the main procedure. Mr Billing was forced to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital (pictured), with surgeons sawing between two teeth and through his jaw to get to the tumour . 'They had to cut through the jawbone and get my face wide open to get to the ulcer then they had to remove some lymph nodes in my neck too, just to be safe in case the cancer had spread.' David spent nine days in hospital after his operation, returning now only for check-ups and once for the smaller procedure to reshape his tongue. He said: 'Usually, people have to go on chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the operation and, during this, the skin tissue used to rebuild the tongue shrinks in size. 'Because I didn't need either, it meant I later needed this smaller operation to have the bit of skin trimmed. 'My tongue's absolutely fine. I had to have speech therapy after the procedure but it's not had any long term impact on my speech or my eating or drinking.' David continued to use a feeding tube and relied on liquid foods until his first proper meal on Christmas Day 2013. And, in another fortunate turn of events, he was offered his old job a JCB back in March 2014. He added: 'JCB actually took me back having originally laid me off because of a lack of work. Mr Billing, who is now preparing to run the London Marathon to raise money for Cancer Research, says his speech is back to normal - though he does have to go to hospital to have his tongue shaved . 'It was the best feeling in the world when, two weeks after coming through the operation, the consultant told me the cancer was completely removed and I didn't even need radiotherapy or chemotherapy.' Now David is preparing to run the London Marathon and is hoping to raise more than £3,000 for cancer research. He said: 'I was not fit or well at all when I was watching the London Marathon last year but I thought how much I'd love to do it. 'I've never done anything like it before so, when I started feeling better, I decided to start training and now I'm about to take part in this experience of a lifetime. 'If I can get over the finish line, whatever time I do it in, it will be absolutely brilliant.'

The lovers who got the most complaints in New York City for loud sex are a handyman and the girlfriend he pops round for quickies with in the building where he works. The 25-year-old boytoy is the lover, of a Dominican woman in her late 30s, who invites him round for romps around her entire apartment in Brooklyn. The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex. Most complained: The building maintenance worker (left) and his girlfriend (right), who is now four months pregnant, were complained about six times for excessive noise at the Bay Ridge block, official records show . Say it loud: This is the apartment block with six calls made to 311 - New York city's non-emergency number - because of complaints of loud sex . Blue: The woman who was complained about was spoken to by police today. She later left, saying: 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone.' The woman whose moans during sex sparked the highest number of complaints in New York said today: 'I'm not hurting anyone'. The woman, who declined to give her name, walked out of the apartment block wearing striped maxi dres, a white jacket and sunglasses. She looked upset and said she was hurt by all the attention - and revealed she was pregnant. She said: 'I'm four months pregnant. 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'. On the job: The building handyman complained about over noisy sex was at work today - at the apartment block where his girlfriend lives. House of noise: The apartment building is in Bay Ridge, close to New York harbor in Brooklyn . No idea: The building's owner Madelene Behefte told Daily Mail Online she had no idea about the complaints . No respite: The front door of the apartment at the center of six complaints for noisy sex. It failed to stop neighbors from overhearing the couple's antics . DNAInfo reported that New York's 311 helpline, for non-emergency complaints to city authorities, recorded a total of 133 complaints about loud sex between January 1 2014 and February 12 2015. Brooklyn, the borough now associated with trendy hipsters and home to would-be president Hillary Clinton's campaign, had the highest number of complaints, at 42. Brooklyn is the most populous of the city's five boroughs. Queens was next with 37, the Bronx and 31 and Manhattan had 23. Staten Island recorded none. The website reported that on November 14 last year, a 311 operator logged: 'Neighbors are having very loud sex with the windows open that can be heard throughout the whole bldg.' The complainant told the website the woman was 'moaning and screaming "Oh yeah, oh, do it to me".' It was followed by another woman shouting at the couple: 'Shut your f***ing windows you wh**e.' Complaints to 311 are passed to police to investigate if they are available, but officers found no noise disturbance when they attended the Bay Ridge block.

Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless. The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, José Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than £300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for. Pacquiao works up a sweat as he shadow boxes during preparations for his May 2 clash with Mayweather . With his eyes closed and grimacing with effort, Pacquiao ramps up his shadow boxing routine on Monday . On his toes and focused, Pacquiao is looking to defy the odds against fight favourite Floyd Mayweather . Roach kneels in the corner as Pacquiao's team prepare the eight-division champion for a session on the pads . The Filipino works his way around the ring, looking sharp after sharing a joke with Shapiro and Roach . Pacman limbers up ahead of his workout on Monday in the gym just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood . Pacquiao is going through his final preparations ahead of the bout billed as 'The Biggest Fight in History' Confident Pacquiao kicks his feet high during his warm-up ahead of training at Wild Card Boxing . There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight. Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout. 'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'

Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to quit because he was becoming increasing depressed watching cable news . Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to call time on his 17 year reign because he was becoming increasing depressed by American politics and watching cable news. Speaking for the first time since making his shock decision, Stewart said he was looking forward to not having to watch the 'relentless' 24-hour news networks anymore. 'Watching these channels all day is incredibly depressing,' Stewart told The Guardian. 'I live in a constant state of depression. I think of us as turd miners. I put on my helmet, I go and mine turds, hopefully I don't get turd lung disease.' Asked if he'd ever voluntarily watch Fox News, Stewart said, 'Let's say that it's a nuclear winter, and I have been wandering, and there appears to be a flickering light through what appears to be a radioactive cloud and I think that light might be a food source that could help my family. 'I might glance at it for a moment until I realize, that's Fox News, and then I shut it off.' Stewart also confessed that his 'moments of dissatisfaction' with the show had started to become more frequent. 'It's not like I thought [The Daily Show] wasn't working any more, or that I didn't know how to do it. It was more, "Yup, it's working. But I'm not getting the same satisfaction,'" he said. 'These things are cyclical. You have moments of dissatisfaction, and then you come out of it and it's OK. But the cycles become longer and maybe more entrenched, and that's when you realize, "OK, I'm on the back side of it now.'" Scroll down for video . Stewart said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance in 2011 . Even the upcoming 2016 Presidential election campaign couldn't reignite Stewart's passion the way it once did. 'I'd covered an election four times, and it didn't appear that there was going to be anything wildly different about this one,' said Stewart. 'Honestly, it was a combination of the limitations of my brain and a format that is geared towards following an increasingly redundant process, which is our political process. 'I was just thinking, "Are there other ways to skin this cat?' And, beyond that, it would be nice to be home when my little elves get home from school, occasionally." Stewart also said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance. The former secretary of defense appeared on The Daily Show in 2011 for an interview, which the comedian says he messed up. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, left, would be taking over . 'He just went into the general gobbledegook,' said Stewart. "Mnah mnah mnah, well, you have to remember, it was 9/11 mnah mnah." I should have pushed, but he's very adept at deflecting.' Rumsfeld, who was on the show to promote his memoir, Known And Unknown, dodged Stewart's questions about faulty U.S. intelligence leading up to the Iraq War. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, 31, would be taking over. Noah has already had to combat  accusations of anti-Semitism over a series of old tweets. Stewart has voiced his full support for his successor, recently calling the incoming host 'incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart.' The exiting host told The Guardian that one reason for  stepping down early in the presidential election cycle was to give Noah a big story to tackle. Stewart said he felt 'that, for the show, you don't want to leave when the cupboard's bare. So I think it's a better introduction when you have something providing you with assisted fuel, like a presidential campaign.'

An eight-grade girl accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in adult jail while awaiting trial, a judge. A defense petition to return 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek to the juvenile facility where she was initially sent after the body of 54-year-old Cheryl Silvonek was discovered last month was denied by Lehigh County Judge Maria Dantos on Friday. District Attorney Jim Martin had opposed the petition on behalf of the teenager, who is charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy. Her boyfriend, Caleb Barnes, 20, who is from El Paso, Texas, but was stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, is charged with homicide. JamieSilvonek, the eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, it was ruled on Friday . Cheryl Silvonek's body was found with stab wounds in a shallow grave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and her vehicle partially submerged in a pond a few miles from the family home. Jamie Silvonek was sent to the county jail this month after she was charged as an adult and is in the women's housing unit, away from older inmates, county officials said. Authorities said Barnes and the teenager met in October, when she was 13, but she told him she was 17. Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. The teen's mother found out about their relationship in early March and ordered them to end it. A day later, the teen told Barnes in a text message, 'I want her gone,' police said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. The 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. 14-year-old JamieSilvonek allegedly conspired to kill her mother Cheryl Silvonek with her 20-year-old boyfriend 'because she disapproved of their relationship' Barnes confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, and that given the age disparity 'there has to be some type of duress or coercion'. He said his client 'cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom' and she feared for her life and that of her father. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life . Police found the body of Cheryl Silvonek in a shallow grave a few miles from her home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby .

Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed for a year after orchestrating a scam to steal £15,000 of goods from the Asda in Basildon, Essex, where he worked . An Asda manager orchestrated a scam that used the supermarket's own delivery service to steal goods worth more than £15,000 - then managed to land a job at Lidl after he was sacked. Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed after running the scam where stock including alcohol, cigarettes, DVDs, computer games and consoles were taken from the store in Basildon, Essex, where he worked. Southend Crown Court heard how the conspiracy was uncovered, following a period during which Gridley and colleague Jay Reed were under suspicion. Thomas Daniel, prosecuting, told the court that goods, ranging from televisions to baby formula, were delivered to Reed's address and presumably sold on. He said: 'Two anonymous reports were received by Asda, one of which suggested Mr Gridley was involved in selling items believed to have been stolen, such as TVs and baby formula. 'When Mr Gridley was ill for a certain period of time, those deliveries stopped, and when he recovered they started again. 'Another email suggested stolen goods being delivered to the address of Mr Gridley's cousin.' But shockingly, after being sacked from the store, Gridley managed to land a managerial role at Lidl in Romford, Essex. Gridley, who was former home shopping manager of the store, was sentenced to 12 months for his leading role in a conspiracy to steal £15,852.46 worth of goods between November 2013 and April last year. The court heard that Reed and another defendant James Munyard had been pressured into taking part in the scam by Gridley, who was their superior. Stock including alcohol, cigarettes were taken from shelves and delivered to addresses using the supermarket's own home delivery service. File photo . Section leader Reed, 23, and Munyard, 21, both avoided prison, but were given suspended sentences of eight and four months, respectively. Mitchell Cohen, representing Munyard, told the court that his client, whose role was confined to taking items off shelves and putting them in a crate, had attempted to be transferred from the store in order to escape Gridley's control. James Munyard (pictured) avoided jail for his part in the scam . Reed was deemed to have been in a position of trust and responsibility in the criminal enterprise, but Recorder Gerard Pounder said he had a lesser role than Gridley, 26, and Munyard even less so. Despite hearing Gridley, of Tilbury,  financially supported his former partner and their two-year-old child but also his own father and grandparents, Recorder Pounder said he had no choice but to send him to prison. He said: 'You were in a position of supreme trust and you say you started this because of threats made regarding a drug debt of your cousin's, you continued even as those threats faded, and brought other people in, too.' Sentencing Reed to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 200 hours' unpaid work, he said: 'You were in a lesser role than Mr Gridley but you were a section leader and had responsibilities. 'In that respect you were somebody who knew the system and it was to your premises these items were taken - without that and your part in the enterprise, it would not have worked.' Munyard, who Mr Cohen said 'didn't have the spine to stand up to what he was being asked to do,' was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, and 100 hours' unpaid work. A spokesperson for Lidl told MailOnline they are unable to comment until an internal investigation has been conducted.

The 14-time major champion is bidding to win his fifth green jacket, but has been plagued by a succession of injuries and even the chipping yips in recent times. The world will find out which version of Woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48pm. Defending champion Bubba Watson, hoping to win his third Masters title in four years, will tee off at 2.24pm alongside England's former US Open champion Justin Rose and 21-year-old South Korean amateur Gunn Yang, who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the US Amateur last year. Those watching the 2.02pm group on Thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game's most colourful characters go head-to-head. Ian Poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet, but even he might meet his match in American young gun Patrick Reed, who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at Doral last year.

Three-time Masters champion Phil MIckelson, hitting from behind trees during practice, will play alongside McIlroy in the first two rounds . Ryan Moore, pictured during a practice round at Augusta, will join McIlroy and Mickelson on the course for round one and two . Woods will be accompanied with Wales' Jamie Donaldson and Jimmy Walker of the USA during the first two rounds of the competition . US Open champion Martin Kaymer is in the group behind world No 1 McIlroy, with Brandt Snedeker and Houston Open winner JB Holmes. McIlroy and Mickelson were among the players battling for the US PGA title in near-darkness at Valhalla last year, with Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light. With 98 players in the field, Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45pm (7:45am local time), with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier, the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while Arnold Palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder. England's Danny Willett will begin his Masters debut in the second group at 12:56pm alongside 1987 winner Larry Mize and US amateur public links champion Byron Meth. Woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth Masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round. The American superstar has started just two events in 2015, carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second, but said he was ready to 'compete to win a golf tournament' after 11 holes of practice on Monday. The final group tees off at 1:59pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world, Australia's Jason Day, Spain's Sergio Garcia and Fowler. Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors last year.

A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by £345 to £975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from £870 to £1,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices . The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from £870 to £1,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game . Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay £345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost £975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season . Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.

A pregnant mother with a rare form of dwarfism has revealed the physical challenges of raising her three-year-old son - who is more than half her size - while preparing for the arrival of her second child. Tiffanie DiDonato, from Swansboro, North Carolina, was born with diastrophic dysplasia and underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries as a child so she would grow to be 4'10 tall, instead of her previous height of 3'8, which is how tall her son Titan currently is. But even with the additional inches, parenting a rambunctious toddler can be difficult for the 34-year-old mom who has certain physical limitations, and often has to use crutches, or sometimes a wheelchair, in addition to being three months pregnant. 'Titan is a typical kid – he wants to do what he wants to do,' she told People of her son. 'And chasing him outside or across the street is not an option for me.' Helping hand: Tiffanie DiDonato, who has diastrophic dysplasia, a rare form of dwarfism, can be seen grocery shopping with her three-year-old son Titan, who is more than half her size, but always willing to assist her . Making it work: The 34-year-old mom from Swansboro, North Carolina, is 4'10 tall and is constantly re-teaching herself to walk because of the stiff muscles and arthritis, which are side effects of her dwarfism . Tiffanie, who married to Eric Gabrielse, a 6’1, 29-year-old Marine who is 6'0, explained that she has to get creative when it comes to dealing with her son - especially when he throws himself on the floor and cries. When tantrums occurs she will walk way and say: 'Mommy can't help when you're yelling at me... No crying and Mommy can help.' Tiffanie noted that this trick, which she has developed over time, usually prompts her son to get up and give her a hug. 'I try my best to let him know throwing tantrums doesn't get you very far - a great lesson to learn, don't you think?' she said. Great news: Tiffanie and her husband Eric Gabrielse, a 29-year-old Marine, are expecting their second child in September . All smiles: Titan happily cuddled up to his dad for this snapshot . Full of life: The three-year-old had a laugh while his dad Eric enjoyed his breakfast . Tiffanie, who co-wrote the memoir Dwarf with Rennie Dyball, has difficulty lifting Titan now that is getting taller because her arms are significantly shorter than most moms. The stiff muscles and arthritis that are side effects of her condition mean that she has to constantly re-teach herself how to walk - which makes chasing after Titan impossible. Losing control of her son is one of her greatest fears, which is why she avoids leaving the house with Titan when she doesn’t her husband Eric or another family member by her side. 'I have even watched Eric struggle to catch him outside and he's a Marine!' she explained. ‘We named Titan correctly, because he's almost too speedy and too athletic.' Because she 'wouldn't stand a chance' against outracing her son, she makes sure she stays '10 steps ahead of the game' at all times. Overcoming obstacles: Tiffanie can be seen as a child wearing braces on her legs. She underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries when she was younger . Painful choice: Tiffanie was expected to be 3'8 tall, but her surgeries allowed her to grow to 4'10, enabling her to be more independent . Tiffanie recalled times in which Titan has climbed into the dryer or wedged himself behind the couch or plopped himself inside the sink. Without physically being able to get him out on her own, she has to rely on her own quick thinking, as well as game she made up to ensure his cooperation. She explained that when she sings: 'One, two, three, help me!' and reaches out for Titan, he will take her hands and pull himself up and out of whatever precarious situation he has gotten himself into. Titan's willingness to lend his mom a helping hand is one of the reasons she is confident that he will be a fantastic big brother. 'He really is - whether he is intentionally doing so or no - becoming my little helper,' she said. 'We conquer the day-to-day challenges together, and I hope we always do.' Sweet moment: Tiffanie and Titan snuggled up together on the couch before he fell asleep . Support system: Tiffanie wore a yellow halter dress while posing for this photo with a friend . Sports fans: Eric and Tiffanie smiled for the camera at a Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium in New York City .

An Old Bailey judge has blasted his junior colleague for ‘taking his eye off the ball’ and passing an 'unlawful' sentence when letting a BT manager dodge jail for a £28,000 expenses scam. Wheelchair-bound  Christopher Starrs, 50, was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in January after admitting his part in a two-and-a-half year con against his employer BT. Starrs, along with fellow BT Openreach manager Phillip Tamplin, invented clamped cars, overtime hours and damage to home owners’ property during broadband installation, and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims. Blasted: Judge Nicholas Cooke QC (left) blasted his junior colleague Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC (right) for 'taking his eye off the ball' when he sentenced Christopher Starrs in January this year . Both Starrs and Tamplin, 53, who made £124,000 from the con, admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses. Tamplin was jailed for two years at January's sentencing hearing, but Mr Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC spared Starrs jail as an ‘act of mercy’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £1,500 fine. However, senior Judge Nicholas Cooke QC has now said the sentence was ‘unlawful’ - and added Starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes. ‘It was an unlawful sentence passed and now I need to do something to put it right, because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter,’ he said. ‘He was mercifully dealt with, sadly by a judge who didn’t have his eye on the ball.’ The judge told Mark Haslam, defending: ‘The sentence was wrong but that’s a matter of personal opinion. ‘Your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison. ‘What the Recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn’t available to him. ‘No one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on Mr Starrs was unlawful. ‘I am sorry to be the headmaster but we really don’t want this sort of thing.’ Fraud: Wheelchair-bound Starrs, 50, was a manager with BT who admitted defrauding the company of £28,000 over two years . The Recorder, who is the head of 4 Bream Buildings chambers and took the Silk in 2006, gave Starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine, and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue. But Judge Cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order. Turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing, he added: ‘This is supposed to be a centre of excellence, when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and can’t do. ‘The judge should have been told what his powers were.’ Prosecutor John Ojakovoh said Starrs offered a ‘blank cheque’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £28,000 he stole. After the judge heard the CPS will now drop the confiscation proceedings, he said the original sentence will stand, quipping: ‘He no doubt thanks his lucky stars.’ Both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time. The main fraudulent claim was for BT vehicles which had been ‘clamped’ by parking authorities. BT Openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work. The company pays out around £1million in fines in London alone every year. Starrs and Tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates. Sentencing Recorder Trimmer, who has led a string of high-profile Serious Fraud Office prosecutions in the last two years, said: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time. ‘It involved over 100 or so false claims, made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity. ‘Both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity. ‘You both knew how it could be conducted, concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally.’ Starrs, of Northolt, Middlesex, who had worked at BT since 1988, was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair. He was not at court today due to a mix-up over whether he was required to attend.

A forensic psychiatrist has testified that Lou Gehrig's disease is the reason a former sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his wife and sister-in-law, whom the defendant described in a suicide note as his threesome partners. Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.

The US body that regulates Internet addresses is looking to crack down on a Canadian company using the new '.sucks' domain name to extract exorbitant sums from celebrities such as Kevin Spacey and companies looking to protect their reputations. So far, purchased names include Youtube.sucks, Bing.sucks, Visa.sucks, Bankofamerica.sucks, Yahoo.sucks, Telusmobility.sucks and other major brand names. Kevin Spacey has reportedly paid have his his '.sucks' domain taken down. Kevin Spacey is reportedly among celebrities paying out to have their name removed from one of the  '.sucks' domains which opened on 30 March . Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains attacking her, CNBC reported. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or 'ICANN,'  sent a letter on Thursday to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Office of Consumer Affairs to see if the actions of company Vox Populi Registry Ltd. were illegal. ICANN initially approved of the so-called top-level domain name, among nearly 600 it has added recently to expand beyond common names such as '.com,' '.org' and '.us.' But it is backtracking after an advisory panel made up of industry groups and companies like Microsoft, Verizon and eBay complained last month. Vox Populi began accepting registrations using '.sucks' on March 30 from trademark holders and celebrities before it is released to public applicants. Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains . It has recommended charging $2,499 a year for the privilege, and according to Vox Populi CEO John Berard, most of the names have been sold by resellers for around $2,000 a year. Berard has said the domain name is meant to create destinations for companies to interact with their critics and called his company's business 'well within the lines of ICANN rules and the law.' Two weeks ago, the advisory body called the Intellectual Property Constituency representing major companies and industry groups asked ICANN in a letter to halt the rollout of '.sucks,' calling it a 'shakedown scheme' and 'predatory.' Companies like GoDaddy.com register some domain names for just $1 a year, and Vox Populi will offer consumers the right to secure a '.sucks' address for just $10 a year starting in September. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme.' ICANN said in its letter that if Canadian or U.S. regulators find Vox Populi's actions are illegal, it could declare the company in breach of its contract and seek to change the registry's behavior. It said it is also seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme .

The semi-final line-up for the Champions League has been confirmed and, although there may be no English involvement, four European giants are just three games from being crowned champions of the continent in Berlin on June 6. With Real Madrid and Juventus winning on Wednesday to join Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the last four, this season's competition is one of the toughest to call in recent memory. We asked our team of reporters who they think will win this season's Champions League. SAMI MOKBEL - Barcelona . Momentum is key at this point in the season and Barcelona are in overdrive. Their early-season woes are a distant memory and Luis Enrique is finally getting his point across. Lionel Messi remains phenomenal and a certain Luis Suarez is hitting top gear just at the right time. Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left) , Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) NEIL ASHTON - Bayern Munich . They overcame their blip (the rip in the seam of Pep's trousers) to power their way beyond Porto in the second leg of the quarter-final and remind everyone just how good they are. They have much to prove after last season's disappointment but they are a phenomenal team. I expect them to draw Barcelona in the semi-final. Bayern Munich produced a stunning display in the second leg to beat Porto in the quarter-finals . JOE BERNSTEIN - Barcelona . Bayern and Barcelona are both better teams than Juventus or Real Madrid and to separate them is nigh on impossible. But given the backroom strife at Bayern, particularly over Arjen Robben's injury, I'd narrowly go for Messi and Barcelona ending their four-year Champions League 'drought'. DOMINIC KING - Barcelona . To think at the start of the season, after Real Madrid pummelled them in the first Clasico, that we thought the beginning of the end had started. Now they look majestic once more and the front three of Messi, Neymar and Suarez gives them an edge over all their rivals. Hopefully it will be a straight shootout between them and Bayern Munich in Berlin. This is the best Champions League semi-final line-up ever and we might get the spectacular final to go with it. LEE CLAYTON - Juventus . Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba and Gianluigi Buffon -  experience, goals and know-how. Tevez isn't Messi (or Cristiano Ronaldo), Pogba isn't Thomas Muller and Buffon isn't Manuel Neuer: Yes, they are ugly bugs on a catwalk of super powers, but they CAN win this. After all, Denmark and Greece both won the Euros. Juventus celebrate their 1-0 aggregate victory over Monaco in the last eight of the Champions League . Juventus striker Carlos Tevez leads the scoring in Serie A this season with 18 goals . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI - Barcelona . Since it's been established that we don't live in a post-Messi (48 goals in 49 starts) world I can't bring myself to bet against him. Would love to see them in a final against Bayern Munich. CHRIS WHEELER - Bayern Munich . After that crushing 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the semi-finals a year ago, and the shock of suffering a 3-1 first-leg loss to Porto in this season’s quarters, expect the real Bayern to stand up and deliver another Champions League triumph for Guardiola. Is it written in the stars that Barcelona will be standing in his way? LAURIE WHITWELL - Barcelona . The front three of Messi, Suarez, and Neymar are beginning to click to devastating effect and the magical allure of Barcelona is returning. It would be some turnaround from the disputes and disappointments of early season, but this is a team full of players who know how to win the trophy. Neymar scored both goals in Barcelona's 2-0 second-leg victory over Paris Saint-Germain at the Nou Camp . LAURA WILLIAMSON - Real Madrid . They might be depleted by injuries but experience and pedigree count in this competition and, as we saw against Atletico Madrid, you can never count against the 10-time winners. Or, indeed, a certain Ronaldo. Javier Hernandez's 88th-minute winner saw Real Madrid edge past their local rivals Atletico Madrid . Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League title and a second in a row with Real Madrid . ROB DRAPER - Bayern Munich . Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben are on the way back, Pep  has a point to prove and the team have the memory of that awful semi-final against Real Madrid last year to drive them on. As long as they don't take their foot off the gas having already won the Bundesliga, they'll make good the disappointment of last year. Robert Lewandowski celebrates one of five first-half goals Bayern Munich scored against Porto on Tuesday . JACK GAUGHAN - Barcelona . I'm tempted to say Bayern Munich but they've got similar buckling deficiencies to the Barcelona we've seen recently. By contrast, the Catalans have found their misplaced defensive steel, have a coach whose win percentage eclipses all to precede him and - well - possess Messi. And Neymar. And Suarez. SAM CUNNINGHAM - Bayern Munich . I would back Guardiola to outwit any of the remaining managers in the tournament with the players at his disposal. Some were writing Bayern Munich off after their 3-1 first-leg defeat by Porto and look how that went. Everyone talks about Messi and Ronaldo, but the collective force of Bayern players is frightening. OLIVER TODD - Barcelona . After a difficult start to the season they've hit form at the right time. Enrique has found a way to get the front three of Messi,  Suarez and Neymar to fire and even if you can keep two of them quiet - as Paris Saint-Germain did on Tuesday - the other will make you pay.

Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.

Steve Davis would love to see Jimmy White and Reanne Evans light up the Crucible stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn. The king of the baize in the 1980s believes the Whirlwind and the doyenne of the women's tour face tall orders to get through qualifying for the Betfred World Championship. Evans saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion Ken Doherty on Thursday, in the first of three preliminary rounds, while White will tackle fellow veteran James Wattana in his opener on Saturday. Steve Davis will attempt to qualify for this year's Betfred World Championship at the Crucible . But Davis, who will also attempt to qualify, expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in Sheffield. He calls 29-year-old Dudley potter Evans 'a great player', and said of the 10-time ladies' world champion: 'It's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods. It's a bun fight, but she's perhaps the best woman player I've ever seen. 'In the 1980s I saw Allison Fisher who was the best around, and she was an excellent, excellent player but more methodical. 'Reanne is more like the Jimmy White or the Ronnie O'Sullivan of the women's game. She has the feel for the game, she's at one with the table. 'She could cause a surprise, but to win three matches is the tough bit. It's hard enough for me and Jimmy. 'If me or Jimmy qualify for the Crucible, it's arguably as big a win as we've ever had. 'I've got a little bit of a desire to do it, but Jimmy would certainly love to get back to the Crucible.' Reanne Evans takes on Ken Docherty for a place at the World Championships in Sheffield . Reanne Evans is a 10-time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010-11 season. She suffered 18 consecutive defeats however and failed to qualify the following year. White, who lost six World Championship finals, last appeared at the tournament in 2006, and has fallen short in qualifying every year since. While 52-year-old White is in the autumn of his career, for Davis these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down. He turns 58 in August and fell off the main tour 12 months ago. A memoir, Interesting, hits the bookshelves on Thursday. A tricky qualifying opener against Jamie Cope could end in disappointment, but it would be short-lived. 'I can't build up the intensity that I used to have, but I must admit I'm getting excited about pitting my wits against another generation of players,' Davis said. 'Of course, it'll all end in tears. 'I'm not totally committed but I still have the juices running through me a little bit. I've been practising but it's not a pretty sight. They're wobbling more in the pockets before saying 'nope'. 'Whether I get to the TV stages, that's a long shot. That's tough. Jimmy White will take on fellow veteran James Wattana in qualifying on Thursday . 'I was still practising hard even when I wasn't getting to the latter stages of the Crucible, and in the end you have to say, 'Yeah, I've tried, but the price is too much investment of time'. 'Now if I've lost a match, by the time I've got in the car I've thought about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day, rather than beating up the person who's come up with me. 'I think it's been a bit like Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I'm sure in the night that someone swapped me for a more mellow version.' Davis won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament, but the 1985 'black-ball final' defeat to Dennis Taylor stands over and above all memories. Dennis Taylor in action during the memorable 1985 World Championship final against Davis . The second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant Davis having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again. 'I don't remember anything as much as I remember the '85 final,' Davis said. 'I do remember the last frame, more so because I've watched it through on video a few times. 'My career was a blur and all games and matches blur into one in the end, it's only the strange moments that do stick in your brain.'

(CNN)Is America a nation divided?  And has Ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions? It's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation: immigration, community and police relations, poverty, education and dozens of other crucial matters facing America. Adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite, and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country. In Ohio, we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services, criminal justice, economic competiveness, infrastructure -- and I've enjoyed sharing our state's winning formula with others in my travels. In 2011, I returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in Congress in the 1980s and '90s.  Over the intervening years, Ohio had lost its way and was hurting. I felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 Ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet. Ohio is much stronger today. And that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing. For example, we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation's strongest state budgets and a nearly $2 billion surplus. We've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones. We've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in America, including tax cuts for the working poor. We're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and Ohio's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade. Getting Ohio back on track wasn't easy. It required big ideas, going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests. Yes, we have a great success story to tell about our state. And we need to make Ohio's success contagious. The leadership style that helped us turn around Ohio is needed in Washington, where America's $18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting Mother's Day if it required their action. Great leaders are not primarily guided by polls, political parties, focus groups, re-election, special interests or protecting the status quo. Instead they bring teams of people together, challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee in Congress in the 1990s, I helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. We worked in a bipartisan effort that doesn't happen enough. There were, of course, disagreements along the way, but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means. Given the polarizing issues facing our country, America needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego, selfishness and power produce. Leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets, tax cuts, welfare reform, border security, immigration and health care. We see it every day. There are certain values that guide great countries: . • Personal responsibility: It obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities. • Empathy: It allows us to walk in someone else's shoes, so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another, better way that makes all of us stronger. • Teamwork: It sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win. • Faith: It tells us we are made special in the image of God with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth. These values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all Americans instead of producing rhetoric, sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform. In Ohio we've implemented this winning strategy. It's worked there, and it will work for the nation as well.

A tortoise has been reunited with his owner after spending nearly a year on the run and even finding a new home - at the age of 109. Owner Wendy Stokes, 74, had given up hope of ever seeing Toby again after he escaped from her garden 11 months ago. But he has now returned home and after piecing together his escapades over the last year, it's become apparent he's had quite an adventure. Reunited: Wendy Stokes, 74, is delighted to have 109-year-old Toby back after his escape 11 months ago . He wandered through a gate in her garden and headed for the open road where he was picked up by a passing driver concerned for his safety and taken to a nearby animal rescue centre. Six months ago, he was re-homed with a couple living in Margate, Kent, 22 miles away from Wendy's farm in West Hougham. But the couple, who could just about make out the word 'Stokes' written in white paint on his shell, felt they needed to find out who Tony belonged to. With nothing else to go on, they decided to call every Stokes in Kent listed in the phonebook. Eventually came across a delighted Wendy, who immediately arranged to collect him. She's had Toby since the 1980s when he was given to her by her late great aunt. He was returned home last Sunday, a full 11 months after his amazing, if a little slow, adventure. Wendy has had Toby since the 1980s and wrote her surname, Stokes, on his back in white paint . Retired farm worker Wendy said: 'I had painted my name and number on the side of his shell but it had faded when he went missing so they couldn't read it. 'The people who found him could read Stokes but they couldn't make out the number. 'He had got out because I had left my gate open. It is normally closed because we have sheep in the paddock but they were in a different field. 'Toby just walked out and trotted towards the road where somebody picked him up and took him to a rescue centre. 'Everyone knows I have a tortoise and we always take him to the village fete so he is a bit of a local celebrity. 'I was devastated when he went missing and spent weeks looking for him in all the fields around the farm.' She added: 'I went all goosey when they told me they had Toby because I had really given up on him. 'It is brilliant having him back and I think everybody was keeping their eye out for him all this time.'

A vicious swan known for terrorising punters and kayakers on the River Cam is now believed to have a grandson following in his footsteps. The savage swan nicknamed Asbaby, which still has many brown baby feathers, has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the Cambridge river. Mr Asbo, the swan believed to be his grandfather, was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 by river authorities after repeatedly attacking rowers. Scroll down for video . Watch out: Savage swan Asbaby has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the river in Cambridge over the Easter weekend . Up close: One resident who lives near the river said Asbaby 'sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers' Theft: Asbaby was seen attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag (above) Capturing the moment: Asbaby (pictured) is believed to be the grandson of Mr Asbo, who was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 . Pecking at the punters: The swan on the River Cam is said to be even more vicious than his father, Asboy, and grandfather, Asbo . Asbaby was seen at the weekend attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag. He is said to have inherited his bad temper from his grandfather, and his father Asboy, who conducted a reign of terror on the river last summer. Harry Crossell, 65, who lives near the river, said: ‘He is even more vicious than his father and grandfather. '(He) sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers. I’ve seen him chasing after punts and taking their picnics. 'Once I even saw him put his beak around a bottle of champagne. ‘It’s terrifying for river users and it’s making people think twice about going out on the water.’ Another resident, Simon Patterson, 52, said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour would get worse as he gets older. ‘The swan is only young at the moment, we’re concerned he will get stronger and more vicious as he grows bigger,’ he said. Shock: The swan got up close with this woman, whose surprise at what was unfolding in front of her could clearly be seen (right) Making an appearance: The juvenile swan nicknamed Asbaby got far too close for comfort to tourists on the Cam over the Easter weekend . Naughty swan: One resident said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour on the River Cam would get worse as he gets older . ‘He swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way. We thought Mr Asbo and Asboy were bad, but this swan is even worse. ‘It’s very worrying as the river is starting to get busier now, if he continues someone could get really hurt.’ But Colin Sparkes, navigation officer for Conservators of the River Cam, told MailOnline today: ‘Most swans get a bit aggressive this time of year. ‘It's mating season - they protect their territory. As far as I’m aware, it's not causing great problems on the river. ‘Swans this time of year start to look out for their nest, and indeed when the young and born. ‘It’s a very tricky one because the more people feed the swans, the more aggressive they tend to become. Close to the camera: Asbaby 'swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way', according to one local resident . Worrying: Asbaby's actions are said to be 'terrifying for river users' and are 'making people think twice about going out on the water' Threatening: The behaviour of Mr Asbo (above) before he was moved 60 miles three years ago left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises . No longer there: The Cam Conservators moved Mr Asbo about 60 miles away in 2012. His son Asboy is seen above in this file photograph . 'They get used to swimming up to people expecting to be fed.’ He confirmed that there are no plans to remove Asbaby from the river, adding that the case of Mr Asbo was completely different. Mr Sparkes said: ‘That swan (Mr Asbo) was extremely aggressive - it's the most aggressive swan I've ever come across. ‘I believe that was probably down to the way he'd been brought up looking for food from various people.’ The Conservators moved Mr Asbo away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself. His behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises - and a marshal was employed during a university rowing race to stop him injuring students. It has previously been reported how Asboy was seen attacking punters, birds and even a cow. He also injured a canoeist and a swimmer.

The Conservative know that they need to turn large parts of the country blue on May 7. And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate Alec Shelbrooke in Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.

After months of speculation - and years of her friends' doubts - Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has admitted she never had cancer. With her business empire destroyed and her online community in tatters, Gibson today admitted her fatal cancer 'diagnoses' were lies. 'No. None of it is true,' she said, during a series of interviews published in the latest edition of the Australian Women's Weekly. In the interviews - which questioned her relationship with the truth and her understanding of cancer - Gibson said she was not seeking forgiveness. 'I don't want forgiveness. I just think (it) was the responsible thing to do. Above anything, I would like people to say, 'Okay, she's human'. Gibson's confession was the first time she has spoken publicly since - under fire from furious former fans - she told Daily Mail Australia she feared for her family's safety. Scroll down for video . Ms Gibson revealed the truth of her cancer diagnosis in an interview . Ms Gibson, pictured kissing her son Olivier, 4, on the head, said: 'None of it was true' Her business empire in tatters and her relationship with her fans broken, Ms Gibson is thought to be struggling financially. The Women's Weekly said she was not paid for her interview . Ms Gibson's interview will be published in this month's edition of the Australian Women's Weekly . The wellness blogger was a prominent Australian social media personality. Her Instagram fan base ballooned after she 'revealed' she had prolonger her life by embracing an alternative lifestyle. Her 'whole foods' business became famously successful. Penguin published her recipe book and her app was to be offered on the Apple Watch. But it all fell apart last month after revelations emerged Ms Gibson had failed to fulfil promised donations to various charities. Friends then began to cast doubts about her cancer diagnoses. She then tearfully 'admitted' she may have been 'misdiagnosed' by a 'Dr Phil'. The  Weekly insists it did not pay for the story and that it was approached by Ms Gibson's 'people', the Melbourne 'corporate advisory' firm Bespoke Approach. Ms Gibson said her partner, Clive Rothwell, was sticking by her in spite of the controversy. But she said he had taken a 'stern' line with her and insisted she play a straight bat. 'He’s been very stern, along the lines of, ‘I just want you to acknowledge where you’ve f***ed up and try not to smooth over that,' she was quoted saying. In the article, titled 'My Lifelong Struggle With The Truth', Ms Gibson also said she had been forced to raise herself from the day she started school. She said she took upon common household responsibilities, such as bringing her brother to school and making lunches. But she would not provide her mother's name or contact details to the magazine. In her previous interview, Ms Gibson said she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion'. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) was also a popular app. It will not appear on the Apple Watch any longer . But she took aim at many of her former fans who she believed had responded 'maliciously' - claiming that her son's childcare details, home address and floor plan were published online. Former friends had called upon Ms Gibson to 'come clean' with the truth about her situation and had long privately questioned the veracity of her story. Authorities told Daily Mail Australia  at the beginning of April that Ms Gibson is still facing an official investigation. A former friend of Ms Gibson directly called on her to 'come clean' in an interview with Daily Mail Australia in March. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want'

A ‘unique and beautiful’ teenage girl was killed by a driver who crashed a stolen car while drunk and high on cocaine and cannabis. Xana Doyle, 19, was a passenger in the Toyota Avensis, which flipped and landed on its roof in an accident in the early hours of the morning. Driver Sakhawat Ali, 23, was more than twice the drink-drive limit and had been taking class A and B drugs before getting behind the wheel. Xana Doyle (pictured) was killed after driver Sakhawat Ali crashed a stolen car while high on drugs . The Toyota Avensis flipped and landed on its roof after the crash in the early hours of the morning in January . A court heard he was driving at ‘excessive speed’ in the moments before the crash, which did not involve any other vehicle. Miss Doyle, who suffered a ‘blunt head injury’, was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales. Ali admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday. Judge Neil Bidder QC told the court: ‘The driver was well over twice the drink-drive limit and it is accepted there was excessive speed.’ The judge said he wanted more information on how much cocaine and cannabis the driver had taken on the night of the smash before sentencing. Ali, of Newport, was remanded in custody ahead of a hearing in July. Sakhawat Ali (pictured right) admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking . The driver’s cousin, Shabaz Ali, 21, admitted allowing himself to be carried in a stolen car following the smash in January this year. The July hearing will decide whether he ‘contributed’ to the accident by pulling the handbrake from the back seat. Floral tributes were left at the scene of the accident and hundreds of people attended the funeral of Miss Doyle, a former Duffryn High School student, in January. In a tribute, her mother Emma O’Donoghue wrote that Xana was an ‘unusual name for a unique and beautiful girl’. Before the crash, Miss Doyle, from Newport, had recently begun working at Wetherspoons as a cook and was also a trained beautician after completing an apprenticeship. Ms O’Donoghue said yesterday: ‘No sentence will ever give me back my daughter or my children their sister. She is dearly missed and this terribly traumatic experience will remain with us for ever. ‘I am pleased that Sakhawat Ali has pleaded guilty, not that he could dispute any of the evidence presented. Miss Doyle suffered a 'blunt head injury' and was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales . Ali was remanded in custody and a hearing in July will determine if his cousin also contributed to the crash . ‘Xana was a beautiful, funny and loving girl and every day is a struggle to live on without her in our lives, we can only hope that justice is served and those responsible are held accountable.’ Paying tribute to Miss Doyle at her funeral, her mother said: ‘You had a smile that would stop this world spinning around. ‘I always knew that you were kind and loving and even through your difficult teenage years you never forgot to tell me how much you loved me and appreciated my support. ‘In the last two years you blossomed into a beautiful young woman, independent and hard-working, making us all so proud of you.’ She added that she had fond memories of her daughter playing and fooling around with her sisters, Lauren and Eve, and her brother Zane. Miss Doyle, whose white coffin was adorned with red roses, gave ‘unquivering friendship and support’ to her friends and family throughout her life, her mother added.

A young woman has managed to find her doppelgänger after launching a campaign on Facebook as a social experiment - and their likeness is mind-blowing. Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old  TV presenter from Dublin, teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed Twin Strangers to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days, and were soon inundated with submissions from all over the world. Incredibly, Niamh found her match in Karen Branigan, 29, a fellow Ireland native who lives just an hour down the road, making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together. Scroll down for video . Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Speaking to MailOnline about her first meeting with Karen, Niamh said: I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the entire duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face, and some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, "Oh my God that’s my face." 'I can’t remember the number of times I said "this is so freaky". It was truly amazing.' Karen, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Niamh has a brother and two sisters, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Niamh said the pair got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities.

'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry says. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!'

They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' Niamh states. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?'

It may have been invented for students to use. But youngsters appear to be deserting Facebook in droves because it is now so popular with their parents – and grandparents. Almost a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’. The trend comes as increasing numbers of older users turn to the social network to stay in touch and share family pictures. Nearly 60 per cent of Britons aged over 55 now have a Facebook account, according to research. Facebook has even started running television adverts to entice the so-called ‘silver surfers’ to join. Now a survey of around 2,000 Britons has revealed that it is having the opposite effect on youngsters. ‘As parents are signing up, their children are logging off to maintain privacy,’ said Lord Jim Knight, chairman of online lobby group the Tinder Foundation. In the poll, a third of Facebook users are said to have blocked a family member so they can no longer see their account or do not receive automatic updates. The survey did not take account of the number of youngsters who have effectively blocked their family members by refusing to add them as a ‘Facebook friend’ in the first place. One in ten people aged 16 to 34 signed up to other platforms so they could remain ‘under the radar of their parents’. But whilst youngsters may be leaving Facebook, they are not giving up on social media altogether. More than half said they had joined Twitter, where only 13 per cent of ‘silver surfers’ said they have accounts. Meanwhile, about 40 per cent of youngsters use the picture-sharing website Instagram, according to the study commissioned by Halifax and carried out by Opinium Research. Logging off: Nearly a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their facebook accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’ Around the same proportion use Snapchat, a social media platform which automatically deletes messages shortly after they are sent. The picture was very different among the over-55s. Just three percent have an Instagram account and even fewer – around one percent – use Snapchat. The way people use these different social platforms is also changing. Around a fifth of those aged 16 to 34 use their smartphones at family dinners, posing a threat to the precious mealtimes that used to be the cornerstone on family life. By comparison, just one percent of silver surfers use their smartphones during a meal with their offspring.

Alan Pardew has warned Crystal Palace's Barclays Premier League admirers that if they want to sign Yannick Bolasie this summer then the bidding will have to start at £20million. It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.' Bolasie scores against Sunderland as he helped Crystal Palace beat the struggling Premier League side .

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini accepts his side are now facing a fight to stay in the Champions League places. City appear to have lost too much ground to Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race and their recent form has led to a further worry, with the sides behind them catching fast. The fading champions could even find themselves in fourth place before they next play - at Crystal Palace on Monday - if results go against them over the weekend. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) shakes hands with David Silva during Manchester City training . Martin Demichelis (left), Wilfried Bony (centre) and Fernando during Friday's session . Frank Lampard (right) looks to play a pass as he and his team-mates are put through their paces . This is not a battle they envisaged having to fight at the start of the campaign but Pellegrini realises nothing can be taken for granted after a frustrating second half of the season. Pellegrini said: 'I think in this league you can never be sure you are going to have a Champions League place. You have six or seven teams that, from the beginning, all of them play for that position. 'At the moment, for the whole year, we have been in a position of the Champions League. I hope that we will continue.' Pellegrini believes his side are now in a battle for the Champions League places and not the title . Manchester City have struggled to keep up with Chelsea, who are closing in on the Premier League trophy . The ramifications of dropping out of the top four, however, are not really something Pellegrini wants to consider, given that he still has hopes of landing the title. With just eight games remaining and a significant deficit to make up on Chelsea that looks a forlorn task, but Pellegrini is not giving up. The Chilean said: 'Of course if we want to continue in the first position of the table we must not drop any more points. It is easy to say but not easy to do it. 'We just know that from now until the end of the season we will try to win all the games and we will see if we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end.' Sergio Aguero has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks but will hope to find the net on Monday . James Milner is in line to return after withdrawing from the England squad with a knee problem . City will hope to be at full strength for the trip to Selhurst Park. Pellegrini reported nothing other than 'small problems' when asked about any injury concerns at his pre-match press conference. That means a likely return for key midfielder Yaya Toure, who missed the 3-0 victory over West Brom a fortnight ago with an Achilles problem but has since played for Ivory Coast. Fellow midfielder James Milner has also been troubled by a knee problem in recent weeks - and withdrew from England's midweek friendly in Italy - but the issue is not thought serious.

Radamel Falcao could still sign permanently for Manchester United after it emerged that chief executive Ed Woodward held talks with Monaco on Sunday over the striker’s future. Falcao, who has scored just four times for United since his season-long loan move from Monaco, drew another blank at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea on Saturday evening. But Woodward told Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev last Sunday that they would make a decision on the right to sign him permanently at the end of the season. Manchester United could sign Radamel Falcao permanently after holding talks with Monaco on Sunday . The striker has endured a frustrating season on loan at Man United and has managed just four league goals . Vasilyev said: ‘I saw the Manchester United people last Sunday and they have not yet decided if they would exercise the option.. ‘It’s not his best season, but they kept the opportunity to make a decision at the end of the season.’ Although it seems highly unlikely that United will keep the Colombian striker, Falcao has been given hope of a second chance under Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Under the terms of the original loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the forward, but it has since emerged that Monaco are willing to negotiate on the transfer fee after a disappointing season at United. Vasilyev added: ‘We are not in any other negotiations, even if big clubs are interested. The decision is with Manchester, then we will discuss with the player what he wants. I would like to have more visibility.’ Falcao missed last summer’s World Cup in Brazil following a knee injury and it is thought he rushed his recovery in an attempt to play in the tournament for Colombia. Under the terms of the loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the striker but Monaco are willing to negotiate . Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward spoke with Monaco president Vasim Vasilyev on Sunday . Vasilyev added: ‘He had mishaps in Monaco. He had problems with the coach Claudio Ranieri, there was a lack of understanding. ‘He was also seriously injured and missed the World Cup. In late August, he came to tell us that he wanted to play at a higher level.” Ranieri has since been replaced by Leonardo Jardim and he has backed Falcao to rediscover his goalscoring form after a frustrating season at United. Jardim, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Juventus in the Stade Louis II, is preparing for his return at the end of the season. Jardim, speaking ahead of his side's home clash with Juventus, is confident Falcao can get back to his best . The Portuguese coach said: ‘He’s not had a great season that is true, but I’m sure he can come back to the levels he was at in the past - that much I’m convinced about. ‘It’s not a question for me, but for the players, I’ve only worked with him for a month.’ Monaco lost the first leg last week in the Juventus Stadium to a controversial penalty and face Massimiliano Allegri’s team in the second leg.

An aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed Germanwings passenger plane may had its electronics 'hacked' before it crashed killing all 150 on board. The theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected Financial Times newspaper from aviation boss Matt Andersson, president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace. The French Alps tragedy which occurred on the flight between Barcelona to Dusseldorf has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28. He is believed to have barricaded himself in the cockpit of the GermanWings A320 Airbus before flying the packed plane into the mountainside as the captain fought desperately to get inside. Scroll down for video . Disaster: An aviation expert says an external factor like 'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the Germanwings plane crash that claimed 150 lives . Tragedy: The crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who investigators say locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet . Investigation: But Matt Andersson - president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace - says any number of causes could have caused the crash . Doomed: Recordings from the cockpit suggested that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (left) locked himself in the cockpit while the Captain Patrick Sondenheimer desperately tried to break in . Investigators point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer. Mr Andersson says the French accident investigators are clear that the stricken plane 'accelerated in its descent'. But he writes in the FT: 'That may be, but it could be from any number of causes, including external electronic hacking into the aircraft's control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception.' 'This is one reason military and head-of-state aircraft are generally installed with specific shielding and additional active protective measures,' and he stresses: 'Civilian aircraft are not.' Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries and come to a firm conclusion. He added: 'The public should patiently wait for a through, multi-party professional air safety investigation, while maintaining an independence of judgment over preliminary official hypotheses.' Setting out his doubts about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary findings, Mr Andersson said: 'Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) of the Germanwings flight 9525 have yet to be subject to international standards. 'Until they are, many broad assertions currently presented to the public may turn out to be erroneous, misleading or in some cases lead to improper or counterproductive regulatory and other reactions –including misplaced liability, financial and insurance claims.' Damaged: Despite revelations from the plane's flight data recorders (pictured), Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries . Aftermath: He claims passenger planes do not have the same level of protection as military jets and someone could have hacked into its 'control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception' Since the crash, European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck, requiring a member of cabin crew to step in if one of the two pilots leaves the cockpit. Mr Andersson writes in the FT that the 'slow drip' of piecemeal judgments from preliminary assessments of data can be counterproductive. He said the European Cockpit Association representing nearly 40,000 professional pilots 'has rightly criticised the premature release' of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder. Investigators say this highlights the co-pilot breathing while locked in the cockpit while the pilot beats on the door outside. Protection: Since the crash which is believed to be caused by 28-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck . Police carried out forensic searches on Lubitz's and his parents house after it emerged that he 'deliberately' crashed the Airbus A320 jet into the Alps . He believes premature release 'could arguably prejudice a formal technical assessment' and Mr Andersson is not the only aviation expert to speculate on the plane being 'hacked'. Former commercial pilot Jay Rollins told US television channel MSNBC last month: 'This aircraft is highly computerised. 'There's one possibility that no-one has brought up. I wonder – could this be a hacking incident?' He drew parallels with the loss of a US drone over Iran, which some blamed on electronic hacking: 'Suddenly the aircraft responding to outside forces. 'If something like that were going on it would be very disturbing for the pilot.'

Lindsay Lohan has been living in London for the past year and says she likes it so much, she doesn't see herself returning to the States any time soon. The 28-year-old flame-haired beauty recently spent a stint on the stage, starring in a West End production of David Mamet’s Speed The Plow - for which she received lukewarm reviews - and seems intent on remaining in the UK for the foreseeable future. ‘[London] feels like home, I miss it every time I have to leave for work and can’t wait to get back,’ Lindsay told Homme Style Magazine while posing for a stunning and seductive shoot for the publication. ‘I go back to NYC and LA for family and work.’ Scroll down for video . Staying put: Lindsay Lohan says she feels 'at home' in London and has no plans to return to the States just yet . Fleur Du Mal Leather Corset . Available at Forward by Elyse Walker . Visit site . We haven't heard much from Lindsay in the US since she moved across the pond to London. But if her latest photo shoot for Homme Style magazine is any indication, she's making a comeback in a major way. The Mean Girls star showed of her svelte figure in a series of racy ensembles by Moschino and Agent Provacateur. Here she poses wearing nothing but a Fleur Du Mal leather corset, La Perla panties, and a pair of Moschino gloves. Corsets were hot on the Spring runways at Givenchy and Versace and continue to be a wardrobe staple for sultry celebs like Madonna and Kim Kardashian. Lindsay's leather number is available to purchase for just under $1,000. That's quite a big budget for lingerie, so we've come up with some alternatives that are less pricey but still have major sex appeal. Style them with a pencil skirt and blazer on your next night out and all eyes will be on you. Jezebel Embrace Strapless Corset at JCPenney . Visit site .

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same "situations" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'

Designer Lilly Pulitzer's family learned that it's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the 'Pink Sunday' rush for the late Ms Pulitzer’s eponymous brand’s brightly-colored, limited edition collaboration at Target. The 250-piece Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the #LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party .

Protesters have demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons during a protest against the gentrification of South London. The store front of its Brixton branch was covered in shattered glass while 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' was spray painted in black across their housing advertisements. A police spokesman confirmed that one man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Thousands of people turned up for the event organised by the Reclaim Brixton group who were demonstrating against local residents and businesses being priced out of the trendy area. One of the event's organisers denounced the violent actions of 'one idiot' but told MailOnline there could be a reason Foxtons - which has a reputation for selling expensive homes - has been 'continuously targeted'. Scroll down for video . Vandal: One vandal smashed the front window of Foxtons Brixton branch (pictured) during a 'wholly peaceful' protest against rising house prices in London . Violent: The lone protester demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons, who have a reputation for selling expensive houses . Defaced: The vandal then spray painted 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' on the estate agent's housing advertisements . Reputation: A spokesperson for Reclaim Brixton - who organised the event - denounced the man's violent actions but suggested there could be a reason Foxtons is 'continuously targeted' Motive: Cyndi Anaso said she is not happy about the vandalism but told MailOnline 'it suggests there's a reason they are being targeted' Response: Police at the scene in Brixton (pictured) had to us CS spray to disperse a group of violent protesters . Cyndi Anaso from Reclaim Brixton told MailOnline said she was 'saddened' that someone behaved 'deviantly' during a wholly peaceful demonstration. But she claims the upmarket estate agents have been targeted before, adding: 'Foxtons has a very poor reputation when it comes to expensive properties and unfortunately.' 'There's a message in it which I'm not happy about but it still suggests there's a reason they are being targeted. 'There's never an endorsement of the attack but nothing else on the day can be considered even slightly violent.' 'I don't even think it's right to apologise for these individuals because every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window.' Foxtons is widely considered as a sign of gentrification and its presence is an indicates that an area either is or has the potential to become very affluent. The Reclaim Brixton event was planned to demonstrate against the rising property prices in London which the group believes is 'displacing the city's communities'. A statement on the Facebook page for the event said: 'The fight against gentrification starts here! Brixton is widely known for its vibrancy, which is another word for social and cultural diversity. Keeping watch: There is still a 'police presence' outside the vandalised store in Brixton, South London following the incident . Defence: Sympathisers and Brixton locals used Twitter to condemn the attention being given to the 'isolated' act of vandalism . Break-in: The Metropolitan Police (pictured) also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall, but were removed shortly after and no arrests were made . 'But Brixton's vibrancy now has a question mark on it. Will Brixton turn into a living museum or will it live?' But alongside images of people protesting peacefully on the streets, social media has been flooded with images of hordes pushing past police and the Foxtons window being destroyed. A police spokesman added: 'A group of protesters then made their way to Brixton Road where the window of a commercial premises was smashed and graffiti sprayed on the building.' Police used CS spray on 'a small group of protesters' who went into Brixton Police Station at around 4.10pm before being removed shortly afterwards. The Metropolitan Police also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall at around 3.15pm, saying: 'Officers entered the building and the protesters were removed.' Grace Lally from Lambeth Housing Activists said the demonstration had attracted thousands of people. Smashed: A Reclaim Brixton spokesperson said: 'Every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window' She added: 'The protest has been lively and strong and loud and people have hung banners off the town hall, blocked the streets and marched through Brixton a number of times and stopped traffic.' Ms Lally insisted the protest was 'really lively' but there had been 'no violence or trouble or anything like that'. Those sympathetic to Reclaim Brixton's protest and locals of the area have taken to Twitter to denounce isolated incidents of violence. Regarding the smashed window, Vanessa Furey from London said: 'Whilst sympathetic to the sentiment, idiots who have done this will have taken away what Reclaim Brixton was about.' And Louise Ridley wrote: 'I live in Brixton. I want people to know about extortionate rents and evictions. But I don't want windows smashed, anywhere.'

(CNN)Pushed to his limits, a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class. In an email to his students, Irwin Horwitz accused them of "backstabbing, game playing, cheating, lying, fighting." The professor at the Texas A&M University Galveston Campus expected his missive would create some conflict, but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly. Those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage. The story went viral. Suddenly, his name was spreading on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, accompanied by the kind of strong, unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you've never met. He was a hero who taught today's entitled youth a much-needed lesson, or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit. One thing was certain: He, and his employer, were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for. "I did what I did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the Internet," Horwitz said. "I will stand by what I did, but I'm not career suicidal." Texas A&M says Horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching. But Horwitz, a nontenure-track professor in the maritime administration program, is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs. Horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial, and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class. The day before writing to his students, Horwitz wrote a similar email to the CEO of the Texas A&M Galveston Campus and to the school's chief academic officer. "I have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful, dishonest and disrespectful" as his current strategic management class, he wrote to the administrators. He accused the students of shirking responsibility, making excuses and complaining their way to better grades. He would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class, Horwitz wrote. "The class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic," he wrote. "But they are your problem now." It was the next day that Horwitz wrote to the students, calling the class "an embarrassment in general," and said that "I am frankly and completely disgusted." Once his words echoed in traditional and social media, the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone. The story was such a talker that even The Onion offered a parody. "I'm not looking to fail students," Horwitz said. "I don't get a bonus for failing students." "The letter sounded a little bit more definite than I wanted it to," he added. He never actually changed anyone's grade. There were some students he wasn't going to fail, he said, and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out. But Horwitz stands by his tough stance; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed, he said. The course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses. "I had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break-even analysis," the professor said. "If you cannot do a break-even analysis, then you don't deserve a bachelor's degree in business." His other complaint was about professionalism. Horwitz said students would swear at him, cheat and spread rumors about him online. This is related to their grades, he said, because dealing with people you don't like is a business skill. On online message boards, users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story. One purported student called Horwitz "a little obnoxious," but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules. Should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral? The fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public, but maybe there is more to it. The situation hits on a popular argument on the media and Internet: What do we think of millennials? Reflecting on his most recent class, Horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered. He mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics, and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration. The other factor is a failure of K-12 education, said Horwitz, who has met college students who don't know how to convert fractions to decimals. "What I'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance," he said. In a statement, Patrick Louchouarn, the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at Texas A&M Galveston Campus, said the entire class will not be failed. "Each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester," Louchouarn said. "The university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies." The flurry of attention is unwelcome and Horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia. But it's likely his story will have a short shelf life. People probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline. But he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere. He said he feels a public shaming of sorts. Online public shaming has become a research topic of its own. People who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance. "This is really destroying my life," Horwitz said.

A northern Indiana pizzeria that closed after its owner said his religious beliefs wouldn't allow him to cater a gay wedding opened Thursday to a full house of friends, regulars and people wanting to show their support. 'It's a relief to get going again and try to get back to normal,' said Kevin O'Connor, owner of Memories Pizza. O'Connor closed the shop for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana. Scroll down for video .

O'Connor, the  61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming . O'Connor said the criticism hasn't changed his beliefs. He said gays are welcome in his restaurant in the small, one-traffic-light town of Walkerton, 20 miles southwest of South Bend, but that he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his Christian beliefs. 'I'd do the same thing again. It's my belief. It's our belief. It's what we grew up on,' he said. 'I'm just sorry it comes to this because neither one of us dislike any of those people. I don't hold any grudges.' A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours.

'I want this to be something that my daughter can enjoy.' Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming. Anger: A protester is seen outside Memories Pizza in this photo with a sign that reads 'Bigots' Uproar: Protesters (like the ones seen here on March 28) have been upset over Indiana passing a new law, which critics said allows businesses the ability to refuse service to gay customers on religious grounds. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana . Family: O'Connor, seen with his daughter Crystal, says gays are welcome in his restaurant, but he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his beliefs . The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. O'Connor says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders . 'We were like, `Stop! Stop! Stop!'" she said. 'It was really making us uncomfortable,' her father said. The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. He says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders. There were no protests as of 7 p.m. Jeanne and Ken Gumm from outside LaPorte, about 20 miles northwest of Walkerton, said they had been waiting for the pizzeria to reopen so they could show their support. 'We couldn't wait to get down here," said Ken Gumm, 66, a tank truck driver. 'To us this whole thing isn't about gay marriage. It's mostly about freedom of religion.'

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today left the door open to a second referendum on Scottish independence before 2020. Before last year's historic vote, Scottish nationalists insisted it was a once-in-a-generation chance to decided on the future of the 300-year-old Union. But Ms Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' In September's vote, 55 per cent of Scots backed the idea of remaining in the United Kingdom. Alex Salmond said the vote was an 'opportunity of a lifetime' and two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: 'We have always said it's a once in a generation thing.' But in a series of TV election debates between Scottish leaders, Ms Sturgeon has shifted her position and today left open the possibility that the promise of another vote could be included in a future SNP manifesto. Under pressure she said that 'something would have to change' before she promised a referendum, and people would have to vote for it. She said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, there is not another referendum on the cards. 'In order for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future, something significant would have to change from the situation we had last year in the referendum.' Ms Sturgeon, who was campaigning in Paisley today, left open the idea of demanding a referendum in next year's Scottish Parliament elections . Opponents claim Ms Sturgeon had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on a referendum, after insisting last year's vote was a once in a generation event . During a fractious and at times shouty debate on BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged her to rule out another vote. Ms Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: 'You clearly don't want to tell people before they vote in this election, what will happen in the next election. 'You have a conference coming up in September, you have 80,000 new members who might be popping along, are you going to put a motion at your conference on this to put a referendum into your next manifesto?' Ms Sturgeon said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, I haven't published the 2016 manifesto. It will be this time next year before we publish the 2016 one.' Mr Rennie said the SNP leader had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on another referendum. He said: 'People need to know whether their vote for the SNP this time round will trigger a referendum in the SNP's manifesto in 2016. Nicola Sturgeon's refusal to answer this basic question makes clear that Scotland faces neverendum. 'It matters because during the referendum we know the SNP took their eye off the ball. As a result, public services were neglected. 'We have seen from Canada the economic impact of an uncertain constitutional environment. Quebec lost jobs and wealth. That damaged the province in the long term. I want a Scotland which builds a stronger economy and a fairer society, balancing the books and delivering more powers.' During a TV debate, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged Ms Sturgeon to come clean on her plans for Scotland . Ms Sturgeon later accused her opponents of 'reviving Project Fear'. The First Minister was questioned about SNP plans to increase Scotland's financial powers, which economists have suggested would leave a £7.6 billion spending gap, during a third televised election debate in under a week. Ms Sturgeon said that full fiscal autonomy would take several years to implement but with new powers Scotland would start growing its economy and revenues. She said: 'This week we've seen the Project Fear that dominated the referendum revived by these three unionist parties, trying to talk down Scotland and assert that we're not capable of running our own affairs.' Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said: 'This (the figure) didn't come from us. You're right in saying this came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It also came from a group of Scottish-based economists that projected the gap to be bigger.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: 'To make this £7.6 billion up Scotland would have to grow at twice the rate of the rest of entire advanced world, so how would you do that Nicola?'

A night of violence gave way to a day of mourning Sunday for a man who died after sustaining serious injuries while in the custody of Baltimore police. Over several hours on Sunday afternoon, a steady stream of mourners filed into the Vaughn Green East funeral home for a wake for Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who died a week after an encounter with police left him with grave spinal injuries. Mourners passed by Gray's silk-draped, white coffin where he lay dressed in a white shirt, black pants, white sneakers and an all-white Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap. Scroll down for video .

Above, more supporters outside of the funeral home on Sunday . Above the lid to the coffin was a floral arrangement and inside the lid was a pillow with a screen-printed picture of Gray flanked by doves and the quote, 'Peace, Y'all' at the bottom edge. Mourners also gathered outside. Some held up signs that read, 'We remember Freddie' and 'Our Hearts Are With The Gray Family.' Melissa McDonald, 36, who said she was Gray's cousin, wore a shirt with 'Freddie Forever' printed on the back. She described her cousin as a nonviolent person. 'He didn't deserve to die the way he did,' she said. A number of mourners like Tina Covington, 46, said they didn't know the family but came to express their condolences. Covington said she has a son near Freddie Gray's age. Gray was detained on April 12 after he ran away from police. He asked for an inhaler as he screamed in pain during the arrest and requested medical attention, but was denied . Gray, who was arrested for carrying a switchblade knife, died a week after the incident from a severed spine . 'It hits home. It really does. It's a reality check,' said Covington, whose son is 27. Covington said that 'there is something going on in the police department that needs to change.' Gray's funeral is planned for Monday. At a church service earlier Sunday, Pastor Jamal Bryant told churchgoers, including members of Gray's family, at Empowerment Temple AME Church that 'somebody is going to have to pay' for Gray's death. Bryant told churchgoers that if 'you're black in America your life is always under threat.'

Barricade: Police stand in helmets near Pratt Street after a march to City Hall for Freddie Gray, Saturday, April 25, 2015 in Baltimore . Roughly 1,200 protesters gathered at City Hall on Saturday afternoon, officials said, to protest Gray's death, which has prompted near-daily demonstrations since he died April 19. Gray was arrested one week before that when officers chased him through a West Baltimore neighborhood and dragged him into a police van. However, a smaller group splintered off and looted a convenience store and smashed storefront windows. A protester tossed a flaming metal garbage can toward police officers in riot gear trying to push back the crowd. Earlier, a group of protesters smashed windows of at least three police cars. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a long-time congressman representing Baltimore's 7th District, told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that there is deep frustration over the case. 'Mr. Gray died a week ago. And I think the thing that upset so many people was the fact that here's a young man. We still don't know exactly why he was arrested,' Cummings said. 'We do know that he was hollering out for aid. He was not given aid after being arrested. ... A lot of people are very, very frustrated as to trying to figure out what happened here, and it's very upsetting.'

Police acknowledged Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested — before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the Police Department's policy. Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray asked for medical help several times, beginning before he was placed in the van. After a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.

A volleyball-playing feline was picked to star in a national TV advert after seeing off competition from thousands of gifted animals. Tortoiseshell Mimi became an internet sensation after her owner uploaded clips of her playing the sport to Facebook. The 30-second-video was shared by thousands of people around the world and features the one-year-old cat playing with 15-year-old Joshua Teague. Joshua’s dad Phil, 56, a computer programmer, bought the cat with his wife Christine, 45, when she was eight-weeks-old in December 2013 from a seller who lived in Birmingham. Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert, which was broadcast last Wednesday (15), after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group earlier this month. He said: 'All the family were really excited to see the advert. Mimi the cat appears in a 30-second video showing her unique ball skills . 'We had everyone around so we could watch it together and we told all our friends that it was going to be on. 'I am really proud that our video was chosen out of thousands of entries. 'It was completely by chance that I uploaded the video on to the Pets At Home Facebook page. The cat is seen playing volleyball with 15-year-old Joshua Teague in the hallway . Mimi was picked to star in the TV advert after Phil shared the video with the Pets at Home Facebook group . 'I just saw something on there asking people to share videos and pictures of their pets so that’s what I did. I didn’t even realise it was a competition. 'The video showed Mimi playing volleyball with my son where he would throw the ball at her and she would keep batting it back. 'I had no idea it was competition so I thought it was a joke when I received an email on April 1 saying our video had been chosen for a national commercial. Mimi is seen in the video batting the ball back to Joshua every time he throws it her way . 'This kind of thing just never happens. 'She is a very talented cat. She has done many times since. 'I think she could get her own TV show.' Administrative assistant Christine said: 'I didn’t even know Phil had uploaded the video on Facebook so I thought it was an April Fools’ joke when he told me about it. 'We normally just skip the adverts when we watch programmes but we made sure to watch this one. 'Although she’s only in the advert for a few seconds, it’s nice to see her on it. 'I never thought when I filmed the video that it would end up on TV.'

Controversial Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans is under attack again with experts warning his 'reworked' baby milk formula is dangerous to babies. Dietitians have singled out a 'happy tummy brew' in Evans' cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, because it contains almost five times the maximum vitamin A dose for a baby. The original recipe for the 'brew' contained more than 10 times the maximum daily intake of vitamin A for babies. Scroll down for video . The paleo diet has been one of the hottest diet trends around, with celebrity followers taking on the lifestyle . The Dieticians Association of Australia said the reworked formula still presents a threat to babies. 'This new infant 'brew' could seriously harm babies,' a spokeswoman for the Dieticians Association of Australia told News Corp Australia. 'The authors seem to have made a serious mistake with this second version of their liver and broth recipe, suggesting they do not understand the basic scientific and nutrition information relevant for infant feeding. 'They have said publicly that they have tried to make it safe by reworking the original recipe, and increasing the age for which it's suggested from 0-6 months to now be 6-12 months, but they have failed spectacularly to meet any safe standards.' The paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle . Evans's co-authors, wellness blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padrin, told Channel 7 last week the dangerous formula had been reworked and renamed 'Happy Tummy Brew'. The pair told the program the recipe had changed. 'We added vitamin C and some calcium,'Carr told The Morning Show. It comes after Evans' recently shared two stories on his social media accounts of women who claimed the paleo diet helped alleviate the symptoms of their multiple sclerosis. A 30-year-old woman, Hollie, wrote she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in September 2013. She said that she endured months of  constant dizziness, altered temperature perception, extreme fatigue, numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression. But after jumping on the Paleo diet bandwagon, Hollie claimed she has not suffered any MS symptoms over the past 12 months, her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever. Hollie's experience led the celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000-plus followers on Facebook on Saturday. Pete Evans has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis . 'WOW this is powerful story on MS, thanks for sharing Hollie.. it will make your heart sing.. it has mine, please tag and share wide!' Evans wrote. The Australian chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg, another MS sufferer. The woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on Evans' 10 weeks Paleo program. The celebrity chef has been a proud paleo advocate . 'I have had a lot of health issues the past years, mainly auto-immune stuff including MS,' she wrote in the online post. 'Having MS means I'm always sapped of energy, have numbness, pins and needles, pain, poor concentration, etc. Not any more!' Marg said she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs. 'No way on earth I could have done that 10 weeks ago,' she wrote. 'My concentration and memory is much better and I can also plan better. I'm not off my MS meds yet but I am off my Thyroid and Reflux meds. 'Thanks so much Pete and team for helping me get my life back. You've made this road so easy. As an added bonus I've gone from a size 16 to a size 12.' The My Kitchen Rules judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy. But, Hollie praised Evans for his endorsement of the controversial diet, and said 'the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable'. 'I have been inspired by your encouragement, great recipes and educated by the accurate information you provide,' Hollie wrote. 'Pete, I thank you so very much for bringing paleo in to the mainstream - people no longer look at me as though I'm a weirdo for following this way of life.' In another recent Facebook post, the Australian chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg who also suffers from MS . Evans has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman 'diet' LaTrobe University Associate Professor of Dietetics Catherine Itsiopoulos pointed out Hollie's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the Paleo lifestyle. 'Her diet may have been poor previously,' Dr Itsiopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we don't know what her diet and eating habits were like before. 'By eating lean meat, good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together. 'But we don't actually know if her condition is cured so it's hard to advocate on because there's no scientific evidence to back this up.' The paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar . University of South Australia Professor of Population, Health and Nutrition Kerin O'Dea said while the diet seemed to have worked for Hollie, it might not work for others. 'Pete can share whatever he likes to his followers but there's never going to be one magic bullet to cure an illness or a serious disease,' Dr O'Dea told Daily Mail Australia. 'Someone reporting an anecdote might be true in one person's case but it's very difficult to imply it to others, which can be quite misleading for people. The paleo style of eating, which Pete Evans is a proud supporter of, has been sweeping across the globe . 'They could feel failure when it doesn't work for them, especially when they try to cure a serious condition like this. 'I wouldn't recommend any particular diet for anyone suffering any type of illnesses.' The paleo style of eating, which Evans is a proud supporter of, has swept  the globe and involves a high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruits, seeds and nuts.

(CNN)A popular Chinese television host known for impromptu satire is now the subject of controversy after being caught on camera cursing the late Chairman Mao Zedong. Bi Fujian, who works for state-run China Central Television, was filmed at a dinner party singing a revolutionary song that eulogizes the Communist Party's early years when he started going off script. "The Communist Party, Chairman Mao. Don't mention that old son of a b***h. He made us suffer so bad," went Bi's improvised lyrics. The other dinner guests burst into laughter. Bi later apologized. "My personal speech has led to grave social consequences, and I feel remorseful for that. I hereby sincerely apologize to the public. As a public figure, I shall learn the lesson from this incident, adhering to strict self-discipline," he posted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform. Making disrespectful references to China's leaders in public is considered a taboo in China, even today. And Bi's comment was directed at the man regarded by many as the country's founding father -- despite his controversial reputation. The 75-second video clip, seemingly filmed on the cellphone of another dinner guest, was uploaded on Monday. Since then, it has been removed from video-sharing sites inside China, although it was still accessible on Weibo. It's unclear when the incident occurred, or what the relationsip was between the camera person and Bi. CCTV said it would investigate. "As a CCTV presenter, Bi Fujian's speech in the online video has led to grave social consequences," the network said in a statement posted on its Weibo account. CCTV did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Fondly known as "Grandpa Bi," the 56-year-old TV personality was born and grew up in the Mao era. The song Bi riffed on was part of a "red" Peking opera that was first performed in the late 1950s. It was popularized during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s -- which was launched by Mao -- when China was torn apart by violence and social unrest. The video quickly divided China's online community. Critics said Bi, as an influential public figure, deserved a harsh punishment. But others rushed to his defense, arguing that Bi was simply enjoying himself in a private setting and was set up by whoever uploaded the clip. The video also emerged just a day before the new head of CCTV started his job, leading some to wonder if it were a case of "a new broom sweeps clean." Mao still divides opinion in China. His giant portrait hangs on Beijing's Tiananmen Gate, and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital. But despite this reverence, Mao's is a deeply flawed legacy. Many remember him as a brutal dictator who inspired fear, paranoia and famine, and whose actions resulted in tens of millions of deaths. CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report.

They said it is not the first time Holcomb had got in trouble for not clearing the till . 'I just had a gun to me. I'm not paying the money,' Holcomb told KHOU. 'I don't think it's right because now I'm struggling for my family because what I had to do to keep my life. 'I mean who's gonna call me? I'm five months pregnant. 'The fact that I got robbed at gunpoint and it's like nobody cares.' Holcomb says she was fired less than two days after the incident. A Popeyes spokesman told KHOU that Holcomb was fired for having too much money in the till. They also said it wasn't the first time Holcomb hadn't cleared the till. Marissa Holcomb, who is five months pregnant with her fourth child, was held at up at the fried chicken chain store in Channelview on March 31 and then fired because of it . The spokesman said that if Holcomb was given the opportunity to pay the money back they were not aware of such a situation. However Holcomb claims she had done her job properly, and that it was an extremely busy night. The chain were offering a popular two piece chicken special for $1.19 on the night of the robbery. 'They got what they got because that's what we made within one hour,' she said. Scene: The robbery occurred at this Popeye's in Channelview, Texas, east of downtown Houston .

A man vying to become the next Kentucky governor has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after a late local celebrity who bid five times for the title but never won enough votes. The 68-year-old Pulaski County resident, who was known as Terrill Wayne Newman until Tuesday, told the Lexington Herald-Leader he doesn't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will 'warm Galbraith's grave.' His predecessor, who died in 2012 from chronic emphysema, gained a following for his wit, sharp dress sense and support of legalizing marijuana. Terrill Wayne Newman (right), who is vying to become Governor of Kentucky, has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after the late local celebrity (left) who bid five times for the title but never won . The newly-christened Galbraith filed paperwork on Wednesday to run as an independent for the state's highest office. The Secretary of State's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by August 11 to get their names on the general election ballot. Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said. Galbraith says he and the late Galbraith were 'not friends per se,' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis. Dea Riley, who was the original Galbraith's running mate in 2011, said she thinks he would find the whole name change amusing. 'I can hear him now: "I'll tell the IRS to send him the tax bill,"' Riley said. But she also said the new Galbraith 'has very big shoes to fill' with his name and she hopes he will honor it. 'To have Gatewood's name and message prostituted, for the sake to garner political office, is a personal affront to me in that I was not only his running mate but equally his friend and confidant,' Riley said.

There looked to be so much bend on Leo Messi’s shot on the half hour at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night that if there had been no net to stop the ball it would kept on curling until it ended up back at the great man’s feet. The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted. Barcelona star duo Luis Suarez (right) and Lionel Messi embrace as Barcelona take a seven-point lead in La Liga . The Barcelona No 10 loses his markers in the Almeria penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike . Barcelona talisman Messi wheels away after opening the scoring  at the Nou Camp during a 4-0 victory over Almeria . Suarez followed Messi's lead by scoring a similar left-footed strike to double the Catalans lead with the first of his two goals . Barcelona defender Marc Bartra stuffs the ball under his shirt after netting a third with a headed goal on 75minutes . Barcelona (4-3-3): Bravo; Alves, Bartra, Mascherano, Adriano; Sergi Roberto, Xavi, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Pedro. Subs: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Mathieu, Pique, Iniesta, Rafinha, Neymar . Booked: Mascherano . Scorer: Messi 33', Suarez 55', Bartra 75', Suarez 90' Almeria (4-2-3-1): Julian; Ximo Navarro, Marin, Trujillo, Casado; Partey, Corona; Wellington Silva (Soriano), Espinosa (Mane), Edgar (Zongo); Bifouma. Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Julián Cuesta in the visitors’ goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Barça number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta’s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo’s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta’s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes.

Brazil full-back Dani Alves rushes to congratulate team-mate Messi after he gives Barcelona a first half lead . The Argentina phenomenon celebrates scoring his 33rd league goal of the season so far . Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria’s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona’s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury. If they don’t do you with the magic of Messi and Suarez then they do you from a dead ball. Almeria had succumbed to all three threats.

Sandra Garratt was in constant agony after undergoing two operations before her death . A grandmother racked with constant pain jumped from the top of a multi-storey car park to end her suffering, her devastated husband has said. Sandra Garratt, 56, went through two years of agony following two back operations for a slipped disc and not even morphine could dull the pain. Last month doctors told the housewife there was nothing more they could do ease her suffering and this was the 'final straw', according to her husband Steve. On Good Friday, the mother of two left her home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after telling her husband she was 'just popping out'. But he became anxious for her welfare and he called the police. At 2.35pm, police and ambulance crews were called to the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, where they discovered Mrs Garratt's body. She had fallen more than 50ft from the top of an Asda supermarket multi-storey car park. Mr Garratt, 57, told how he gave up his job as a community transport driver last year to care for his wife. He said her suffering had intensified in the last 18 months of her life and the pain had spread to her legs, feet and fingers. He added: 'She was in pain every minute of every day. She was a happy lovely person but withdrew from her happy family life. 'Before there had been hope but when there was nothing they could do, it was the final straw. 'Everybody says the same – she is now free from the pain. That's the only bit of comfort. 'The doctors and GPs, within the scope of the NHS waiting lists and everything that goes on, did everything they could.' Mrs Garratt leaves behind daughter Lucy, 37, son Jonathan, 26, and two grandchildren, Joshua and Jessica. The coroner has been informed of her death. Mrs Garratt told her husband she was 'popping out' on Good Friday. Hours later her body was found at the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, West Midlands .

A young Star Wars fan, who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies’ creator George Lucas asking whether he would allow Jedi Knights to marry in the future, was elated to receive a reply granting his request. Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric told Inside Edition: 'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy was on hand to film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son, who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It’s very black and white. There’s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don’t have emotions, but they do. It’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'

The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 at auction. The unique psychedelic cartoon, which is hand-painted, depicts the eponymous submarine from the 1968 film in which the Fab Four travel to Pepperland to save it from the Blue Meanies. The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas, Texas, on Thursday . The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the Yellow Submarine film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The 1968 film starred The Beatles (above) It features handwritten notes instructing artists on the correct colours to use when recreating the submarine. More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch £10,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time. Yellow Submarine was a success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album a year later . The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. The original cel is set to sell for £10,000 . 'It is a film that has stood the test of time and is as relevant today as when it was made in 1968. The Band Concert is the most expensive cel sold . The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported £280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference. 'It would be one of the earliest final versions of the Yellow Submarine hand-painted - it really is the holy grail of Yellow Submarine memorabilia. 'Since small stickers were used for when the sub travelled there are not really a great deal of Yellow Submarine cels out there. 'This comes from a former Yellow Submarine ink and paint department employee. 'It is an unusually large image. Colour model cels were used also to help determine the final approved colour scheme of the yellow submarine. 'Colour model cels from this film are very rare, and this is one of the single best cels of the Yellow Submarine we have seen.' The Animation Art Signature Auction will take place in Dallas, Texas on April 9.

A terminally-ill landlord whose dying wish was to marry his partner of 26 years saw their special day descend into farce after a series of blunders. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home. But, instead of having the magical day they had planned, the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly. Guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over, and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather, 54, after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple's special day (pictured) was full of blunders . Guests at the couple's (pictured) wedding were forced to listen to the song 'Wonderful Life' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on, rendering it invalid . Mr Haigh, who died weeks after the ceremony in November last year, was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he'd let her down. In fact, the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House in the city centre, where the pair said their vows. Mrs Haigh, 54, said: 'Geoff was heartbroken by it all. He kept apologising to me and saying he'd wished we'd got married years earlier and done it properly. 'He was devastated, as the way he saw it, this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness.' The couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once Mr Haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal. However, the landlord of The Ram's Head pub, in Oldham, was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely. The pair then settled upon the Manchester venue as it was not too far from their home. It took three people two hours to get Mr Haigh ready for his big day and, determined to make the day perfect for his bride-to-be, he battled through pain to make it to the venue. Mrs Haigh, 54, said every guest at the ceremony -  held in November last year in Manchester  -  wrote a letter of complaint. She has three marriage certificates (pictured) as the first two were riddled with errors . The couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony (pictured) and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date. An amended version posted later was full spelling errors . However, it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began. They said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down. Then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows, which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar. Mrs Haigh, a mother of three, said: 'There was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after I asked I was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day. Geoff Haigh and his wife Heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day. 'It felt like they were merely using us a practice go, like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them.' After the bride and groom said their vows, guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music 'Wonderful Life' while the registrar went out of the room. Unbelievably, almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before Mrs Haigh was compelled to take action. She said: 'Everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on. We couldn't believe it. 'It had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now.' After the ceremony, as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant San Carlos, the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate. They were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected, otherwise their marriage was invalid. Mrs Haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead. However, when the second certificate arrived in the post, it was addressed to Mrs Haigh in her maiden name 'Taylor' and included spelling errors on the document. A third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple. Mr Haigh (above) passed away in January this year, just weeks after his wedding to long-term partner Heather. The couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year . Mrs Haigh (left) said her new husband (right) was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down. She has received £137 from the Manchester register office following the calamity day . Mrs Haigh said: 'It felt like they didn't recognise we were married and that really hurt Geoff before he died. 'It made if feel like the whole thing didn't happen, like it meant nothing at all. It was devastating. 'The guests were all in tears for us. They were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously.' The newlyweds were offered a £137 refund but Mrs Haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough 'loss' to warrant compensation. She said: 'It wasn't about the money, but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband. 'It was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more. They said "we all make mistakes and we are only human". 'That's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man's dying wish and the most special day of our lives, that attitude is not acceptable.' The wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House (pictured)  in the city centre, where the pair said their vows . The family has since received an apology from Manchester City Council, which runs the register office based at Heron House. A spokesman said: 'I'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs Taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations. 'These types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious. They understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding.' However, tragically, Mr Haigh died on January 4 this year before receiving the apology. His wife added: 'Geoff was determined not to die over Christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come, and he didn't want that for us. The energy it took from him to hang on, I couldn't believe.'

Washington (CNN)This week is the 100th anniversary of what many historians acknowledge as the Armenian genocide -- the Turkish massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians . And it's also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word "genocide" to describe the atrocity. It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word "genocide" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a "genocide" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago . In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. "The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence," he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. "We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians . In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. "No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on," she wrote.

Jailed millionaire Robert Durst pleaded not guilty Tuesday to the newest charge against him - a federal charge of possessing a gun after a felony conviction. U.S. District Judge Lance Africk set a trial date for June 22. Durst is an estranged member of the wealthy family that operates 1 World Trade Center. He also faces a murder charge in California and two state weapons charges in Louisiana - one of possessing a .38-caliber revolver after a felony conviction and one of possessing the firearm along with an illegal drug: about 5 ounces of marijuana. Claiming innocence: Suspected murderer Robert Durst appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to a new charge of gun possession. Pictured above leaving federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana in handcuffs after the court appearance . Durst pleaded guilty to two federal charges in Pennsylvania in 2004: possessing a firearm while a fugitive and while under indictment. However, his lawyers say those convictions don't make it illegal for him to carry a gun under Louisiana law. The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of 55-year-old Susan Berman, a longtime friend -allegedly because she was going to talk to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. He was arrested early March 15, less than 12 hours before HBO aired the final segment of 'The Jinx,' in which - off camera in a bathroom but with the microphone still live - Durst whispers, 'There it is. You're caught!' After about 10 other short sentences and disjointed phrases, he says, 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' Durst was arrested last month on suspicion of the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. The two pictured together above . It's believed that Durst killed Berman because she was about to speak to investigators about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife Kathleen McCormack. Pictured together above . Tuesday's hearing had its own bizarre moment when prosecutor Mike McMahon asked Durst if he understood the maximum penalties he faced if convicted. Durst responded: 'And you are?' Durst's attorney and the judge then explained to him who McMahon was. Durst is being held without bail in a state prison where the Orleans Parish mental ward is located, because the sheriff's office says experts found him a suicide risk. Defense attorneys and prosecutors met with a different federal judge last week to discuss another federal matter: whether two FBI agents and a state trooper on an FBI task force should be held in contempt of court for failing to show up at a hearing last week before the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court magistrate. Federal prosecutors moved that part of the case to federal court Monday; Durst's attorneys have not filed their response and have said they would not comment until they do. Durst's lawyers say his arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the conclusion of 'The Jinx.' Durst had registered at the Marriott under the name Everette Ward and was lying low while HBO aired the final chapter of his life story. Authorities said they found a passport, a head-and-chest latex mask, a handgun and marijuana in his room. His lawyers say it was searched illegally.

A Montana judge who was censured by the state's high court for his comments about a 14-year-old rape victim has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that former state District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors. Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher. Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. At Rambold's August 2013 sentencing, Baugh said Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold, the Billings Gazette reported at the time. Baugh, per the newspaper, described the teenage girl as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth. Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. Scroll down for video . Selected: Former District Judge G. Todd Baugh has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. He sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that a 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher . Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence. Legal case: Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez (right) shared some responsibility for her rape by teacher Stacey Rambold (left) Baugh, who served almost 30 years as a state judge, stepped down last year after being censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days. He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he didn't know who nominated him for the achievement award. He also repeated his assertion that media reports about the rape case had not told the whole story. 'I'm not trying to say I didn't make any mistakes. If you go into all the mistakes that were made, it would give a better-balanced report,' Baugh said. Fehr said Baugh had been nominated for the award by members of the bar association, but she declined to say who that was or why he was chosen. Case: Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence . Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. Baugh later apologized for his remarks. He was also censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days . Marian Bradley, Northwest regional director for the National Organization for Women, said the award was inappropriate given Baugh's conduct on the bench. Regardless of his prior accomplishments, Bradley said the Rambold case cannot be overlooked. 'The last chapter in his career, he put himself out there and did not protect a young girl and did not protect a community,' Bradley said. 'Giving him a lifetime achievement award is going to send people into tailspins.' Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. In December, state District Judge Russell Fagg wrote in a column for the Billings Gazette that Baugh handled more than 30,000 cases in his career. 'He has made thousands of good calls, and a few bad calls, as have all of us,' Fagg wrote. 'Bottom line: Baugh is a wonderful person.'

Kelly Ripa has been grief stricken following the sad news that her friend, cosmetic surgeon Dr Fredric Brandt, was found dead by suicide at his Miami mansion on Sunday. So it's understandable that 44-year-old TV star was looking morose as she left her New York City apartment on Tuesday. The Live With Kelly & Michael co-host, who is usually seen smiling, wore a frown as she left the building alone. When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life.' Sad day: Kelly Ripa looked to be in mourning on Tuesday as she left her NYC apartment; on Sunday it was announced her surgeon friend Dr Fredric Brandt had died . The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice.' The former soap opera actress was dressed casually in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on. The beauty was carrying her coat as well as some papers, a cell phone and her purse. Casual look: The former soap opera actress was dressed down in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on . Feeling the pain: On her show Live With Kelly & Michael, the host told Michael Strahan that she will miss the doctor who had worked on the morning program . Near tears: When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life' Heartfelt: The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice' The day before the New Yorker tweeted her condolences for Dr Brandt, 65, who was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry.  Madonna and Stephanie Seymour were clients. 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer,' the star wrote. Her husband Mark Consuelos, retweeted choreographer Isaac Calpito's post, which read: 'Devastated over the loss of our dear friend @drfredricbrandt. You are missed. You are loved. The world has lost one of its kindest souls.' They were close: Dr  Brandt was remembered by  Ripa (left with the surgeon in 2011) in a tweet on Monday following his tragic suicide at his Miami home on Sunday . Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.' The City of Miami Police Department confirmed that Dr Brandt's death on Sunday was a suicide by hanging. An autopsy was scheduled on Monday, the coroner confirmed. Miami Herald columnist, Lesley Abravanel had said Brandt had been 'devastated' recently over rumors comparing him to a character on the Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Her note: The 44-year-old beauty's tweet said, 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer' Abravanel, a Miami Herald columnist, posted a series of tweets on Sunday claiming that he had been 'devastated' by unflattering comparisons to Dr Franff on the  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, according to  sources close to the doctor. The doctor's longtime publicist Jacquie Tractenberg told The New York Post on Monday: 'The show definitely deeply hurt him, he was being made fun of because of the way he looks. 'It is mean, and it was bullying. But the show was not the reason for his depression, and it was not the reason he would take his own life.' The Tractenberg & Co PR agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. Was he bullied?: Dr  Brandt (left) has a resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly 'devastated' by the portrayal . His colleague, Dr Robert Anolik, who worked with Brandt at his practice, posted a moving tribute on Monday. The acclaimed dermatologist wrote: 'Dr. Fredric Brandt died yesterday. For nearly 5 years, Fred and I worked side by side. He was far more than a colleague to me. He was a close friend. I will miss him every day.' The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami by his housekeeper where he lived alone. She called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. The New York Post also wrote a column last month comparing the real-life doctor to the fictional doctor on Tina Fey's hit comedy. 'Sources: Dr Fredric Brandt was "devastated" over comparisons to the protagonist on Tina Fey’s new Netflix show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt",' Abravanel tweeted. Behar tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed' An eye for art: Dr Brandt, a cosmetic dermatologist and well-known art collector pictured in front of a piece from his collection at his apartment in New York City on March 7, 2014 . Dr Franff only appears in one episode, titled 'Kimmy Goes To The Doctor!', of the first season. The character shares Dr Brandt’s smooth skin, platinum blond hair and enthusiasm for plastic surgery, but his door sign claims he’s a ‘board certified D, DS, DDSOBGYN’, rather than a cosmetic dermatologist. The Dr Franff character is depicted on the Netflix show with a high-pitched laugh and unable to speak certain words due to his plastic surgery. He is also seen drinking  from a surgical bag and reinflates his own face after being punched. Netflix had no comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy.

Moscow (CNN)A Russian TV channel aired Hillary Clinton's first campaign video with a rating stamp that means it's for mature audiences, because of fears it might run afoul of the country's anti-gay propaganda law. A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. "There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't," a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. "Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video)." Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, "I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about." The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that "gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights." Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as "a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia." Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. "I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them," Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). "We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone," he said before the 2014 Games. "That's why you can feel safe and free here," he added, "but please leave our children in peace." The rights group ILGA-Europe said in a May 2014 report that Russia was the worst place in Europe (out of 49 countries) for LGBTI people to live.

Ralph Cramer, 70, and his wife, Lynn, 59, were returning home from the Creekside Café in Mount Joy at about 9 p.m. on Sunday when the accident occurred . Manheim Borough Police Chief Joseph Stauffer told Lancaster Online that the vehicle left the road, flipped over and landed upside-down in a ditch. It was not immediately known who was driving or if the couple had worn seat belts. The top was down when the wreck occurred. Stauffer says there's evidence the vehicle started to skid at a slight left turn, then went off the road and hit an embankment near a barn. The vehicle had been rebuilt or restored, with new elements. 'There are no indicators of what caused the accident yet,' said Stauffer. The investigation continues and Manheim police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

(CNN)A French-language global television network regained control of one of its 11 channels Thursday after a cyberattack a day earlier crippled its broadcasts and social media accounts. Television network TV5Monde was gradually regaining control of its channels and social media outlets after suffering what the network's director called an "extremely powerful cyberattack." In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. On a mobile site, which was still active, the network said it was "hacked by an Islamist group." ISIS logos and markings appeared on  TV5Monde social media accounts. But there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group. As day broke Thursday in Europe, the network had regained the use of one of its 11 channels and its Facebook page, Paul Germain, the chain's editor in chief, told BFMTV, a CNN affiliate in France. However, by late morning, a number of pages on the network's website had messages saying they were under maintenance. The outage began around 8:45 p.m. Paris time (2:45 p.m. ET) on Wednesday. TV5Monde offers round-the-clock entertainment and news programming that reaches 260 million homes worldwide, according to the Ministry of Culture and Communications. It functions under a partnership among the governments of France, Canada and Switzerland, as well as the Wallonia-Brussels Federation. Other networks that provide content to TV5Monde include CNN affiliates France 2 and France 3, France 24 and Radio France International.

A singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner. Captured in a front room in Bahama, North Carolina, the three dogs – a Husky called Sky, a brown and white Springer Spaniel called Sadie and a black and white Springer Spaniel called Marshall – take their positions on their make-shift stage. Getting the tune underway, Sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on Sky’s ear as if whispering something – Sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction. The video begins with Sadie the Springer Spaniel barking and interacting with the Husky named Sky . The Springer Spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the Husky joins it, but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl. Following the Husky’s lead, the Spring Spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another. Meanwhile the other Springer Spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner. No, it's like this! The Husky begins howling, causing the Springer Spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead . All together now! The three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony . Before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl, which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo. The trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder. The howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs – who continue to wag their tails – showing any signs of letting up. No encore? The owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise . Eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying: ‘Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.’ And the three dogs, rather put out about being interrupted, stopping and turning to look at him in surprise.

Former Holland forward Dirk Kuyt is returning to Feyenoord next season, aiming to end his professional playing days at the club that was a launching pad for nine years at Liverpool and Fenerbahce, the Rotterdam club announced Friday. Kuyt signed a one-year contract with Feyenoord, who are currently third in the top-flight Eredivisie, but said his stay will likely be longer. Kuyt grew into a favorite among Feyenoord's fanatical fans during his first stint with the club from 2003-2006, after transferring from Utrecht. He was the Eredivisie's top scorer in the 2004-2005 season and was named Dutch footballer of the year in 2006. Dirk Kuyt (left) is returning to Feyenoord, nine years after leaving the Dutch Eredivsie club for Liverpool . Kuyt retired from international football in October after finishing third with the Netherlands at last year's World Cup - a tournament where he underscored his versatility by playing on the wing and at left back. He made 104 appearances for the Netherlands and scored 24 goals. He also was part of the team that finished second in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, losing to Spain in the final. The 34-year-old said now is a good time to return to Rotterdam as "I'm fit and have a great drive to make a success of my time at De Kuip," Feyenoord's stadium. Feyenoord director Martin van Geel said that although Kuyt signed only a one-year deal both he and the club intend his stay in Rotterdam to be longer. "Dirk can keep going for years," Van Geel said. "As far as he's concerned, he can become the Ryan Giggs of Feyenoord and we will add many more years. This will be music to the ears of all Feyenoord fans." The forward has had a successful career for Liverpool, Fenerbache and playing for his country .

While it might be the nation's largest grocer, Walmart Supercenter was ranked at the bottom of the barrel  in a recent survey of America's supermarkets. The retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in Consumer Reports' annual survey, and this year it was rated number 67, the second worst supermarket. As it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine, Walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce. However, it was noted for its better-than-average prices. Walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in Consumer Reports' annual supermarket survey . The retailer (above a worker in the produce section of a Walmart in Miama) came in at number 67 followed by chain Waldbaum's, which was in last place . 'Every store I go in has room to improve,' said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a statement that the company released to Consumer Reports. 'I can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better. 'And if we nail those, one store at a time, our short-term performance gets better.' The respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness, food quality, freshness and staff courtesy. Walmart was joined by A&P (rated number 66) and Waldbaum's (number 68), which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed, according to CBS. The annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts, which was cited by a quarter of respondents. Other findings included: . Source: Consumer Reports . America's favorite supermarket, taking first place, is New York-based Wegmans. The retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness, baked goods and overall shopping experience. Publix came in second place followed by Trader Joe's, Fareway Stores and Market Basket. Wegmans was also among a total of three grocers, including Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, that earned outstanding produce scores. 'It's going to sound cliché, but our employees are our secret sauce,' Jo Natale, Wegmans' vice president of media relations told Consumer Report. Natale also shed light on the fact that Wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded, which 'allows us to take a long-range view, invest in people, and grow at a controlled rate.' While only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely  satisfied with the quality of their store's produce, meat and poultry offerings; nationwide, Consumer Reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings. Findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including Wegmans, Publix, Costco, Whole Foods and Fresh Market were considered standouts in this category. So as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $5,400 on food, what makes a supermarket the best? The survey noted that those who were the 'freshest' stores were usually the best  overall. Wegmans (file photo above) was rated America's favorite supermarket followed by Publix, Trader Joe's and Fareway Stores . In the past, check out speed and low prices might have satisfied customers, but the survey said they are now also demanding a wider variety of healthy, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. They also want more organics and local produce. 'There's a growing rejection of overly processed and packaged foods, especially among younger consumers,' says Willard Bishop's Jim Hertel. 'They're suspicious about food additives and so sure 'less is more,' that they buy gluten-free even if they're not allergic to gluten.' 1 Wegmans . 2 Publix . 3 Trader Joe's . 4 Fareway Stores . 5 Market Basket (Northeast) 6 Costco . 7 Raley's . 8 Sprouts Farmers Market . 9 Fresh Market . 10 Stater Bros. 11 WinCo . 12 Hy-Vee . 13 H-E-B . 14 Aldi . 15 Whole Foods Market . 16 Fry's . 17 Harris-Teeter . 18 King Soopers . 19 Fred Meyer . 20 Food City (KY, TN, VA) 21 Hannaford . 22 Meijer . 23 Dillons . 24 Smith's Food & Drug . 25 Lowes Foods (NC) 26 ShopRite . 27 Schnucks . 28 Food 4 Less . 29 County Market . 30 QFC . 31 Kroger . 32 Save Mart . 33 Ingles . 34 IGA . 35 Bashas' 36 Marsh . 37 Piggly Wiggly . 38 Tom Thumb . 39 Giant (PA) 40 Cub Foods . 41 Shoppers Food & Pharmacy . 42 BJ's Wholesale Club . 43 Big Y . 44 Ralphs . 45 Target/SuperTarget . 46 BI-LO (GA, NC, SC, TN) 47 Sam's Club . 48 Brookshire's . 49 Vons . 50 Albertsons . 51 Price Chopper (Northeast) 52 Food Lion . 53 Weis . 54 Giant Eagle . 55 Winn-Dixie . 56 Giant (DC, DE, MD, VA) 57 Randalls . 58 Safeway . 59 Jewel-Osco . 60 Stop & Shop . 61 Acme . 62 Pick 'n Save . 63 Tops Markets . 64 Shaw's . 65 Pathmark . 66 A&P . 67 Walmart Supercenter . 68 Waldbaum's . 1 Wegmans . 2 Publix . 3 Trader Joe's . 4 Fareway Stores . 5 Market Basket (Northeast) 6 Costco . 7 Raley's . 8 Sprouts Farmers Market . 9 Fresh Market . 10 Stater Bros. 11 WinCo . 12 Hy-Vee . 13 H-E-B . 14 Aldi . 15 Whole Foods Market . 16 Fry's . 17 Harris-Teeter . 18 King Soopers . 19 Fred Meyer . 20 Food City (KY, TN, VA) 21 Hannaford . 22 Meijer . 23 Dillons . 24 Smith's Food & Drug . 25 Lowes Foods (NC) 26 ShopRite . 27 Schnucks . 28 Food 4 Less . 29 County Market . 30 QFC . 31 Kroger . 32 Save Mart . 33 Ingles . 34 IGA .

We take more photos of ourselves than ever - but it seems selfies are doing little for our self-confidence. Women typically take and delete five pictures before settling on a selfie they feel comfortable posting online, a survey found. And men are happy only on their fourth try. The new survey found women typically take and delete five pictures before they decide they like a selfie . UKIP leader Nigel Farage poses with some young voters while out canvasing in Broadstairs. The survey, carried out by OnePoll, found men are also guilty of taking multiple selfies before they post one they like . Two in three women (64 per cent) feel anxious just having their photo taken, while looking at snaps on social media made 41 per cent feel bad about themselves, according to a survey of 5,000 people by market researchers OnePoll. Of the children who were also questioned, which included 58 per cent who took selfies, 79 per cent said they were happy with the way they looked, 67 per cent thought they needed to look good. ITV's Good Morning Britain show, which commissioned the research, is encouraging viewers to share the first selfie they take on social media under the hashtag #SelfieEsteem. Jamelia, Nicky Byrne, Beth Tweddle, Richard Madeley, Piers Morgan, Nancy Dell’Olio, Rebecca Ferguson are among the celebrities backing the campaign. Piers Morgan appears on Good Morning Britain along with presenter Susanna Reid. The ITV show commissioned the survey and is encouraging viewers to share the first selfie they take on social media . The survey also found a third of women were worried they were passing on body confidence issues to their children and 41 per cent of children did not think their mother was happy with the way she looked. It also found 15 per cent of women and 19 per cent of men had cropped, filtered, or retouched pictures of their children.

A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, "Wow!"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.

(CNN)Thinking about presidential candidates?  Apparently, hormones are a major factor one should consider. According to one female businesswoman in Texas, Hillary Clinton shouldn't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she'll start an unnecessary war. When George W. Bush waged an unnecessary war in Iraq -- was his testosterone to blame? As Cheryl Rios, the CEO of Go Ape Marketing, sees it: "We're built differently, we have different hormones. In the world that we live in, I understand that there's equal rights and that's a wonderful thing and I support all of that. I don't support a woman being president." "With the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war," Rios wrote in a Facebook post. If Rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the Oval Office, she'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president. Throughout history, male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders' decision-making. Studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts. If science doesn't convince you, just Google "cheating politicians" for the long and sordid list of men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Sanford and John Edwards, whose hormones got the best of them. Rios has taken a lot of flak for her "biblically" inspired beliefs, but she's not the only one who's arguing that a woman's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern. Time magazine declared Hillary Clinton the "perfect" age to be president, because she's a postmenopausal woman who is "biologically primed" to lead. (She also happens to be a former first lady, senator and secretary of state.) I'm not joking. Believe me, I wish I were. No wonder Jon Stewart left "The Daily Show" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing. If discussions about a candidate's hormones are what we have to look forward to, the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed. But underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration: The bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015, a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias. We want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything. And you'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college, graduate school and the work force. But what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability, but a bias in how women and girls are viewed. Unfortunately, Cheryl Rios' view of women is not unique. Some people believe women have "our place" and that place is not at the table. They'll tell your daughter to "go for it" but believe she isn't qualified to fulfill her dreams. In a compelling series about women and work, Wharton School professor Adam Grant and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes. The evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless. It's overt: There are more men on corporate boards named John, Robert, William or James than there are women on boards altogether. The bias is also covert: When students rate their favorite professors, they describe the men as "geniuses" and the women as "nice." The bias is real, yet so many of us are blind to it. Hillary Clinton might not be the perfect candidate, but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the White House a much steeper climb. That's not just a problem for Democrats -- it's a problem for Republicans, Independents, everyone. The fact is, equality benefits everyone. It's better for the bottom line (companies with more women in leadership roles make more money).  It's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier, healthier, and more successful. It's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages.  And it's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results. Our nation, our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men. It's not enough to say to our daughters: "You can be anything you want to be." What we need to say is: "You can be anything you want to be, despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong." Rios said that if Clinton is elected, she is "moving to Canada" because "a female shouldn't be president."  Apparently Rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about Canada: Kim Campbell became the country's first female prime minister in 1993. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Canadians elected their first female prime minister, Kim Campbell.

Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after an evening in which their relegation into Sky Bet League One was marked by pre-match supporters' protests against Karl Oyston. Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation . Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen. 'We got off to a flyer and having got back to 1-1 I'm a little bit disappointed we didn't take anything on a horrible night on a horrible pitch.'

Real Madrid have 48 hours to make a decision on Javier Hernandez as the clock runs down on their first option to buy the Manchester United striker. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Monday that the European champions would take stock of Hernandez's situation at the end of the season. However, under the terms set out by United when they loaned the 26-year-old to Madrid, Thursday April 30 marks the end of the Spanish club's 'exclusivity period' to buy the player. Javier Hernandez is enjoying a fine run of form at Real Madrid - scoring three times in his last two games . Hernandez (centre) returned to training with his Real Madrid team-mates on Tuesday . Hernandez (second left) was all smiles in training, but the 26-year-old faces an uncertain future . From Friday they will no longer have first option and United will field offers of around £10million from West Ham, Southampton and Lazio. The Mexico striker who has scored three goals in his last two games has one year left on contract at Old Trafford, but his latest displays have boosted his valuation. Ancelotti said: 'It is a subject that we will evaluate at the end of the season. What I can say is that I have liked his professionalism during the whole year. He is enjoying his opportunity a lot, he has a high level of professionalism and for a coach to have these type of players that are always ready is very positive.'

(CNN)People magazine has anointed Sandra Bullock the world's most beautiful woman of 2015, the publication revealed on Wednesday. Bullock, 50, joins a long line of actresses to receive the honor, including last year's cover girl, Lupita Nyong'o, and Gwyneth Paltrow in 2013. She seems to be taking it all in stride, calling the whole thing "ridiculous." "Real beauty is quiet. Especially in this town, it's just so hard not to say, 'Oh, I need to look like that,' " she told People. "No, be a good person; be a good mom; do a good job with the lunch; let someone cut in front of you who looks like they're in a bigger hurry. The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying." The cover story focuses on Bullock's home life with her son, Louis, 5, and her efforts to stay healthy and fit past her 40s. "I was putting him to bed and told him that even when I'm old and gray and more wrinkly than I am now, I'll still love him and want to tuck him in," she said. "And he asked why I have wrinkles, and I said, 'Well, I hope some of them are from laughing so much.' And he touched my face and said, 'You're not old, you're just happy.' " The Oscar-winning star of movies including "Gravity," "The Blind Side" and "Crash" said she's happy with who she is. "As long as I'm healthy and strong and I don't let this mind of mine run amok with insecurities about what I am not, I can look in the mirror and like who I see." The selection of Bullock, the oldest woman to receive top honors in the history of the list, is a sign that beauty knows no age, say some. "Great choice! Gorgeous, talented, over 50 and FABULOUS! That's the way it's done!" wrote one fan on People's Facebook page. Also making the "most beautiful" cut this year: Gabrielle Union, Ariana Grande and Laverne Cox. The issue hits newsstands Friday.

When Malia asked her mom about how to park in a public parking lot, the first last admitted she was stumped. 'I barely know now too so I have to check with other sources,' she said. The first lady also discussed a Time magazine article which named Malia and sister Sasha among the 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014.

President Obama and the first lady greeted participants at the White House before the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday . Tens of thousands of people gathered on the White House South Lawn for the annual Easter egg roll festivities which the president officially started by blowing on a whistle . The first lady — who is celebrating the fifth anniversary of her Let's Move! campaign — also noted that both her teenager daughters are very familiar with the concept of sarcasm. 'When they get a little snarky, I'm like, 'Oh, you sound like your dad!'' Tens of thousands of people gathered on the White House South Lawn on Monday for the annual Easter egg roll festivities. This year's theme is #GimmeFive, which is part of Mrs. Obama's campaign to try to get young people to be more active and lead healthier lives. Monday's events included sports and fitness zones, cooking demonstrations, and of course, the traditional egg roll. The egg roll is one of the longest-standing White House traditions. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling.

Rev Howard-John Wesley had opened the service by welcoming the president, before urging the congregation not to take selfies with him. 'How fitting that on the day we celebrate the rising of our Lord and savior, we also welcome our sitting president,' Wesley said, as the congregation rose to their feet in applause. 'This is not selfie time,' Wesley said jokingly. 'Let the brother worship in the house of God.' Churchgoers traditionally walk around to shake hands and give hugs during the greetings and announcements portion of service, but the pastor encouraged the crowd to stay in their seats and greet only their closest neighbors, as the sanctuary was tightly secured with Secret Service agents. The choir - including women in purple dresses and men sporting purple ties - sang a lively rendition of the hymn 'He Lives,' stirring most of the church, filled to capacity, to clap, sing and sway in praise alongside the upbeat organ keys while ushers collected the tithes and offering. Singalong: The family (pictured in the second row of the congregation) joined in with upbeat hymns . People queued around the block for the service in Alexandria, monitored by federal security officers . The lively pastor based his sermon around a scripture from 1 Corinthians 15 on the life and resurrection of Christ. 'Where do you stand in the resurrection of Christ,' he asked. 'You either believe it or reject it.' Wesley said the sacrifices of Christ allowed the congregation to be forgiven for their own sins. 'He took the pain for me. I owe him my life. I owe him my praise. I owe him my hallelujah,' he said. Appearing on Jimmy Fallon's talk show this week, the first lady revealed that she and her husband will be performing a routine with So You Think You Can Dance contestants on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll. It will be to the tune of Uptown Funk. Michelle said she has been practicing the dance, called Gimme Five!, for over a year in the hope that it will inspire children to exercise. Well wishes: Michelle Obama tweeted this message to her thousands of followers on Sunday morning .

Jane Tipper had been walking her dog Molly when the eight-year-old chased a lamb over a cliff . A Border Terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall after chasing a spring lamb off the edge of  a cliff before spending three days stranded on a remote beach. Dog Molly had been on a walk with owner Jane Tipper and her daughter Hannah in Eype, Dorset, last week when the she fell over the cliff's edge along with the lamb. Molly survived a vertical drop of 100ft then rolled 150ft down a steep slope and coming to rest in gorse near the bottom. Her distraught owners managed to see that the eight-year-old had survived the drop, but had no way of getting down to the beach to get her. A team of ten coastguards arrived on the scene and a winchman was lowered down the cliff face but was unable to find her despite four hours of searching. Ms Tipper, who had been celebrating her 64th birthday, was forced to return home in nearby Charmouth without her beloved dog which she has had since she was a puppy. She contacted the website DogLost which arranged for missing posters to be put up in the area. Three days later, Molly was found in an exhaustive state after walking a mile further along the beach to an area popular with dog walkers. It is unclear what had happened, but luckily, she has come through her ordeal relatively unscathed - but there has been no sign of the lamb since the incident. Ms Tipper said: 'I was with my daughter, it was my birthday and we planned a short walk and lunch in a local cafe but we never got there. The border terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall, including a 100ft vertical drop, in Eype, Dorset, but her owner had no way of reaching her. Coastguards searched thoroughly but were unable to find her . 'Molly's usually very good, she doesn't chase animals. 'She fell about 200ft but the cliff was on a slight slope. I couldn't see her at the bottom but my daughter did so we knew she survived the drop. 'The coastguard winched one of them over the cliff and he went from side to side looking for her but couldn't see her. 'It's rocky there, there's thick patches of gorse and it's extremely dangerous. 'After a couple of hours they said they just couldn't spot her. They were very upset about it.' She added the incident left her 'completely numb'. 'We didn't stop searching at the end of the day,' she said. 'When I got home I phoned as many people as I could think of.' But fortunately, a female dog walker recognised Molly from the lost posters that had been put up in the area on Friday. After Ms Tipper put up missing dog posters, Molly was identified by a dog walker three days after going missing. Pictured right, the cliff face in Dorset where Molly fell . Ms Tipper added: 'The lady was walking her dogs when Molly followed her and sat next to her. She called me and we met up and fortunately it was Molly, I was worried it was going to be someone else's dog. 'Molly was very pleased to see me, especially when I got a gravy bone out of my pocket. 'She wasn't hurt or limping or anything, but she was shattered and spent the rest of the day asleep when we got home. 'I think it's really knocked the stuffing out of her. ' A coastguard spokesman urged dog owners to always keep their pets on lead while walking near the coast.

(CNN)Sawyer Sweeten grew up before the eyes of millions as a child star on the endearing family sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond." Early Thursday he committed suicide, his sister Madylin Sweeten said in a statement. He was 19. "This morning a terrible family tragedy has occurred," Madylin Sweeten said in a statement passed on by her manager Dino May. "We are devastated to report that our beloved brother, son, and friend, Sawyer Sweeten, took his own life. He was weeks away from his 20th birthday.  At this sensitive time, our family requests privacy and we beg of you to reach out to the ones you love."

Sawyer Sweeten was born in May 1995 in Brownwood, Texas. He was a year and a half old when he started on "Raymond," playing next to his real-life twin brother Sullivan, who starred as Michael Barone, according to the website IMDb. Their sister, Madylin, played their TV sister Ally Barone. The show was about the adults, and the children, especially the twins, had bit parts, adorable cameo moments.

A video showing a man cracking a giant egg to reveal another fully formed egg inside, may be enough to scramble your brain. YouTube user Elman511 cracked open the over-sized egg that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ While the instance is extremely rare, it’s caused when the hen is in the process of forming an egg in her oviduct and another oocyte – the ovum or egg cell that becomes the yolk of the egg – is released too soon. Scroll down for video . Egg-traordinary: US YouTube user Elman511 cracked open an over-sized egg (shown on the left) that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ In the video, Elman511 cracks the egg, which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. He then cracks the smaller egg, which also has a yolk and white inside. ‘That’s the end of the nesting dolls of egg…an egg inside of an egg… crazy man,’ he said, before noting that the yolks look rich. Egg-citing: In the video, ‘Elman511’ cracks the egg (pictured), which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. The unusual occurrence is down to a counter-peristalsis contraction . This is when a second oocyte (yolk) is released by the hen's ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The unusual occurrence is called a counter-peristalsis contraction. A hen releases an oocyte from her left ovary into her oviduct every 18 to 26 hours, Back Yard Poultry Mag explained. Usually, the oocyte travels down the oviduct, adding layers of the egg until it’s laid through the hen’s vent. But in a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The phenomenon has been mentioned as far back as 1250 AD by the Dominican friar and polymath Albertus Magnus in his book De Animalibus. Ask the egg-spert: In a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. This results in an egg with another made inside it, producing two yolks (pictured)

(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for "lost" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the "holiday" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the "mistake" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the "war on women" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious "war on women" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The "war on women" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the "war on women" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative "solution" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.

Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge . A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman . 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'

An investigation has concluded Freddie Gray broke his neck after falling head-first into the back of the police van as it was moving, it was reported today. Medical and law enforcement sources briefed on the police investigation told ABC News Gray's 'catastrophic' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt 'in the back door of the van'. They claimed there was 'no evidence' Gray sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest, which was caught on camera on a street side on April 12. According to ABC's sources, Gray was standing in the van, bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door. It is believed he fell into the door, breaking his neck. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A report claims Freddie Gray broke his neck when he fell head-first into the back of the van as it was moving . Similar van: Freddie Gray was stood, bent over, with his head facing the back door of a van like this . Timeline? It is believed Gray fell head-first into the back of the van, breaking his neck, during the journey . Inside: The above diagram shows the inside the police van . Pictured: The second stop which police failed to report in their paperwork after the van journey, during which Freddie Gray sustained a 'catastrophic' head injury. It was picked up by a privately-owned security camera . According to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray . The news comes hours after Baltimore Police admitted the van transporting Gray made a previously unreported stop. The mysterious detail was picked up by a privately-owned security camera, and will be integral to the police investigation into Gray's death, which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on Thursday morning. It is not known why the van stopped at the corner of North Fremont Ave and Mosher Street before it made another two stops then finally transported Gray to the hospital. And police have yet to clarify why Gray would have been standing without a seat belt on. Just nine days before his arrest, the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy, making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van. Revelation: Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop. He refused to elaborate on the details of the new information . Police Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to elaborate on the new information. He said the contents of the report, which was completed and handed to the State Attorney at 8.50am Thursday, will remain confidential as they continue to investigate. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested. The report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver, who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators, according to ABC. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton. As the police department, Mayor's office, and state prosecutors refuse to address the development, it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of Gray's arrest more than two weeks ago. A relative of one of the suspended police officers told CNN she believes Gray was injured during his arrest outside the van. Her family member, she said, was based inside the van, and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he 'didn't do'. However, this theory is at odds with the medical examiner's report which allegedly found Gray sustained injuries by falling over inside the van, where he had been placed without a seat belt. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN her family member was in the van with Gray as he screamed and cried for medical help. But she believes the spinal injury which led to Gray's death was inflicted earlier, during his arrest on April 12. In an appeal that echoes Gray's family, she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow. 'Six officers did not injure this man,' she told Don Lemon. Secret stop: This is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stop . These are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stop . Jung Hwang's convenience store's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting Freddie Gray . 'Six officers didn't put him in the hospital. 'I'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did, that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.' Her words came after a police document was leaked to the Washington Post, in which the other prisoner in the transport van with Gray said he could hear the 25-year-old slamming himself against the wall. The prisoner speculated that Gray was trying to hurt himself. In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'. However, he admits he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton . The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family. 'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we've seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' Outrage over the unexplained death of a black man in Baltimore, Maryland prompted nationwide protests against police brutality on Wednesday from Houston to Boston. Baltimore has been the scene of near-nightly protests ever since the April 19 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who is believed to have been fatally injured while in police custody. State Attorney Marilyn Mosby urged the public to be patient as she reviews the information. 'While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,' Mosby said on Thursday. 'We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.' Freddie Gray: The 25-year-old was poisoned by lead paint as a child growing up in Baltimore . Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west side . Nicknamed 'Pepper', he was described by an ex-girlfriend as happy-go-lucky with an infectious sense of humor. The Baltimore police knew him, however, as a 5ft-8ins felon who had notched up at least 18 arrests and a handful of convictions - mainly for Class A drugs but also burglary, assault and illegal gambling. He was said to have set off running at the sight of police patrolling a well known open-air drug market. He was taken into custody for possession of a switchblade and during transport to the station he experienced what officers described as 'a medical emergency'. Gray, who had asthma, requested an inhaler and had trouble breathing in the van, but police didn't provide his inhaler. According to Gray's family his spine was severed 80 per cent at his neck, three vertebrae were fractured and his larynx was injured. Court papers describe Gray's childhood as problematic. He lived with his heroin-addicted disabled mother in a home in Sandtown-Winchester that contained enough poisonous lead in the peeling painted walls and windowsills for a court settlement to conclude that he and his two sisters were incapable of leading normal functioning lives. Lab tests conducted in the 1990s showed that they had levels of lead in their blood nearly double what the state of Maryland defines as the minimum for lead poisoning. In Baltimore, more than 2,600 children have been found to have high levels of lead in their blood, according an annual report released by the Maryland Department of the Environment in 2014. 'This is the toxic legacy of lead-based paint,” Ruth Ann Norton, head of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative and a founding member of the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission, told the Baltimore Sun. 'Our kids are ill equipped to stay in the classroom, finish school. They’re very unlikely to go on to higher education. They’re less likely to be able to hold a job', she said. 'They’re less equipped to be able to overcome the poverty and other circumstances that pull them down. Children with lead poisoning will have defects, regardless of whether their parents are ‘nice’ or not.' Gray lived off the resulting 'lead check' settlement although it is unclear exactly how much he received. Whatever money he did have he was said to spend buying designer accessories. The Sandtown neighborhood is a 72-block neighborhood made up of almost entirely of African Americans. More than one-third of residents live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter are unemployed. The majority of Maryland's state prison population are said to said to hail from Sandtown, according to the Justice Policy Institute.

Screeching around the track in a car he last drove more than 50 years ago, Sir Stirling Moss appears to have lost none of his racing pedigree. And at 85, the man widely seen as history's greatest all-round racer has revealed the unusual daily routine he thanks for his impressive longevity – 77 press-ups and half a bottle of Chardonnay. Sir Stirling, who won 212 races in his 14-year career, also spoke about how he has swapped the high-octane vehicles of his heyday for a tiny electric car that has a top speed of just 50mph. Reunited: Sir Stirling Moss sitting behind the wheel of the refurbished Austin-Healey Sprite . Success: The 85-year-old won 212 races during his 14-year career before a crash at Goodwood in 1962 . Back in action: Sir Stirling examines the refurbished car alongside Car SOS presenter Fuzz Townshend . Speaking to The Daily Mail, Sir Stirling said he sees fitness as a 'way of life' which is why he is still so confident behind the wheel. However, never one for strenuous gym sessions, he puts his health down to more unusual methods. He said: 'I have half a bottle of wine a day, which fits in very nicely, and that's it. I do what I call lady press ups and I do 77 a day. 'It's not as difficult as it sounds because I do them from a kneeling position. I could not do 70 press ups like I could when I was 30 years old. 'I've broken various bones during my career so I'm not that flexible. I think staying fit is a way of life more than anything else really.' When it comes to diet, he said he believes in indulgence and never denies himself something he wants. He said: 'I never go to bed hungry, let's put it that way, especially as Susie is such a fantastic cook. Car SOS sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. Above, Sir Stirling with presenters Fuzz Townshend and Tim Shaw . Sir Stirling drove the refurbished car in 1962 - one month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career (pictured above). He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks . 'I allow myself whatever I want but I would have to say my indulgences are that Susie and I drink one bottle of wine each day, white certainly, Chardonnay. And chocolate. I'm trying to cut that down but not that successfully.' He made the revelations after a new documentary reunited the father-of-two with the Austin-Healey Sprite he used as a training car before the 1962 Sebring three-hour race. The race took place a month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career. He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks. He returned to the cockpit a year later but decided against competing professionally as he felt he was no longer driving instinctively. The Austin-Healey Sprite was also used by the rest of his team, including Hollywood star Steve McQueen and racing legends Innes Ireland and Pedro Rodriguez. Car SOS, which broadcasts on the National Geographic Channel on Thursday, sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. While he found fame hurtling around corners at death-defying speeds, Sir Stirling now takes a more measured approach to the road. For the last 18 months he has been driving a Renault Twizy, an electric car with a top speed of 50mph. He said of the car, which retails for less than £7,000: 'I live right in the middle of London, right by Hyde Park Corner, and the limitations on an electric car like that, you don't notice them. 'If I lived outside the North Circular there might be times when I'd think "Crickey, I wonder if I'll make it back on the charge" but having said that, the Twizy is just the sort of car to have around London. Sir Stirling has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. Above, the couple at Silverstone in July 2011 . 'It is absolutely very different to the cars I used to drive. There are certainly good reasons to have a petrol car but living where I do, in the centre of London, I can't think of anything better than what I have got.' Sir Stirling, who was knighted in 2000, said he would not want to be a professional driver today because he thinks there are too few races. He said: 'It's quite different now though, they only do 18 races a year, I was doing 52 because I would go down to Australasia in the winter or Malaysia or South Africa and do all types of racing. ' It's so different now that you can't compare the life of a driver then and now. It's unfortunately one of those things that has moved on and I don't think will ever be able to move back.' He has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. He added: 'If your wife is your best friend that's the important thing to me. If every decision you think about or make or take you discuss with her first, I think that's very important. 'But then Susie says I do what I want anyway.' Car S.O.S. broadcasts on Thursday April 9 at 8pm on National Geographic Channel.

The police officer accused of murdering Walter Scott will be banned from seeing his first-born child for several months, it was revealed today. Patrol officer Michael Slager will be refused the right to hold the baby which his wife Jamie is set to give birth to in a few weeks. He is only granted video access to his eight and a half month's pregnant wife and an officer stands outside the booth whenever he talks to his family. They are not allowed to spend any time together and contact is via video screens with headphones at the Charleston County jail. But the baby will not be able to enter the South Carolina prison. Before the fall: Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, with his wife Jamie before his arrest. Slager was charged with murder after shooting Walter Scott, 50, after stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina . Visit: Michael Slager received a visit at Charleston County Jail last Friday from his pregnant wife and mom . It is deemed unsafe for an infant to enter the prison so Slager will have to rely on photographs as cell phones and access to the internet is forbidden. He will be informed by a telephone call and have to wait to see photographs, which will be examined by officials before being presented to him. When Jamie attended the jail on Friday, she was made to turn through the prison's reception area and take a seat next to a video screen for a talk with him which lasted around two hours. The booths are protected by screens to prevent onlookers from seeing inmates, but appointments have to made in advance. Relatives of other prisoners queued to use the video booths after registering with prison officials behind thick glass security screens as Jamie and her accused husband talked with the aid of headphones. But their first child together will not be allowed to visit him in prison until jail chiefs decide that the baby's health would not be at risk from being there. Although there is no specific age limit, prison policy is not to allow babies in. No date has yet been set for his first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away. Major Eric Watson of the Charleston County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online: 'He is treated just like any other prisoner, except for being in protective custody. 'His baby won't be coming to the prison and he will not be allowed to see the child. It could be several months before he does. 'His attorney can apply for the baby to be brought to the jail if he wants.' Walter Scott was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen. Family tell says the light was an accessory and both mandatory stop lamps were functioning . Slager, 33, already has two step children from his wife's previous marriage, but the new baby will be the first for him and Jamie. Major Watson said Slager had no access to the internet and was under close scrutiny to deter any threat from angry prisoners over the shooting of Walter,who was gunned down by the officer after being stopped for an apparent faulty tail light on his Mercedes. Walter's supporters and family say he was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen and this was wrong because the light was an accessory and both his obligatory stop lamps were functioning. Major Watson said Slager was being offered three meals a day and recreation time, but was isolated from other inmates. Housed in a room with one small window, he has no interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail. One released prisoner said outside the gates: 'Man, it ain't no holiday being in there. He has to watch his back more than most because of what he did. There's a lot of angry men in there, black and white.' Walter's brother Anthony said police faced 'many questions' about traffic stops based on racial profiling and that his brother's death should serve as a catalyst for a change in police policies. Meanwhile, the man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton. No date has yet been set for Slager's first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away . The mystery man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton . The 30-year-old was detained by police as Walter fled his Mercedes Benz before dying in a hail of bullets and later released. Pierre's family said they had no idea why he was in the car and how he came to be friends with the shooting victim. His grand mother Eunice Fulton, 70, said: 'I spoke with my daughter Franetta on Thursday and Pierre had only just told her he was in the car. 'It was a terrible incident but we haven't had the chance to speak to him about it. He used to live with me until a couple of years ago. But I don't where he hangs out now. He moves around.' Pierre, who was known to police, had stayed in the background since Walter was shot by officer Michael Slager and at the weekend rejected media requests for interviews. He has given a full statement to investigators, but police refused to reveal his name and what he has told them. He had requested privacy. Pierre was caught on the policeman's dash cam after Walter had fled and been shot. But police released him without charge and he was not suspected of any crime. He has convictions for unlawfully carrying a pistol and served 174 days in prison in 2005 and has been arrested several times. His grandmother added: 'He is a good grandson. He cares for his family. But I don't know what he is doing now.' Pierre has worked as a cleaner, laundry man and warehouseman over the years, but some members of his family have lost touch with him. Rosanne Grant of Alternative Staffing employment agency told Daily Mail Online: ' He worked at various jobs over the period of a year through me. The last time I hear about him was in 2006 and nothing since. I don't know what he has been working at.'

The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was ‘no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident’. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had ‘existed for some time prior to the accident’. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell’s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.’

Sunderland are trailing former Wigan striker Franco di Santo. The Argentine is playing for Werder Bremen and has scored 13 goals in 22 games this season. The Bundesliga side want £8million for the 26-year-old who Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton knows well from his time at Chelsea. Sunderland are considering a summer move for in-form Werder Bremen forward Franco Di Santo . The Argentine has been in superb form for his club this season, netting 13 goals in 22 games . Di Santo began his senior career with Chilean side Audax Italiano in 2006, before catching the Blues' eye two years later. However, he failed to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and following a similarly ineffectual loan spell at Blackburn Rovers, was sold to Wigan in 2010. He spent three seasons with the Lancashire-based outfit, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances. Di Santo was an unused substitute during the club's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2013, before being released at the end of that season. He made the move to the Bundesliga in August 2013 and has appeared to fulfil some of his early promise. Di Santo previously played for Chelsea but struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and was sold . Di Santo played for Wigan for three seasons, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances before being released .

(CNN)Roseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: "My vision is closing in now," she said. "I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up." Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making . Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) "It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of," explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. "Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision," Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy . Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk . Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . Eat your greens . Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries . Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke . While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.

Eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements, a study has claimed. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.

Jessica Silva has spoken about why she had to kill her abusive husband and revealed she hopes his family can one day forgive her for what she did. In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video .

'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, "you're fat, you're ugly", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said "it was just a rash".

'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how "I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.' See the full story on 60 Minutes at 8.30pm on Nine tonight .

(CNN)A 32-year-old Massachusetts man is facing murder charges, authorities said Wednesday, four days after another man's remains were found in a duffel bag. The Middlesex District Attorney's Office said that Carlos Colina, 32, will be arraigned the morning of April 14 for murder in connection with the remains discovered Saturday in Cambridge. Earlier this week, Colina was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. A Middlesex County judge then revoked bail for Colina in another case he's involved in, for alleged assault and battery. The victim in that case is different from the one whose remains were found in recent days. Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. "This was a gruesome discovery," District Attorney Marian Ryan said. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.

Fired: Major General James Post III was fired on Friday after making a treason comment . An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane. A-10 retirement: The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the A-10,  low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support . The inspector general's investigation interviewed several witnesses who remembered Post using the word 'treason' to describe efforts to oppose the Air Force leadership's decision to retire the plane, either via a social media campaign or by talking to Congress. In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.' General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander. Post issued an apology on Friday and said he did not intend to try to prevent people from talking to lawmakers. Handed in a latter: General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander .

Ukip candidate Kim Rose (pictured handing out sausage rolls today) is being investigated by police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls . A Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event, which also saw veteran snooker player White play pool with local youngsters. Mr Rose, a jeweller, said he was oblivious until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. Laughing off the allegations, he said: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes. 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties. 'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 'He said, "it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.' Mr Rose, who will now have to report to a police station on Monday, added: 'It was a fantastic day. We laid on teas, coffees, sandwiches and some sausage rolls. 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.' Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right) branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll' Today Mr Rose was seen out in Southampton handing out sausage rolls to members of the public . He said: 'The Ukip support is very strong here and I feel the main political parties will do anything they can to scrutinise everything about us.' Mr Rose added that if other politicians fear voters could be 'bribed with sausage rolls', perhaps it is not surprising they will not trust the country with a referendum on EU membership. Today the parliamentary candidate was out campaigning on the streets of Southampton, handing out sausage rolls to members of the public. Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, backing Mr Rose. He said: 'I think it’s utter nonsense. There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions. 'Having a few sausage rolls I don’t really think counts as one of those.' Mr Rose said the event, which was attended by 250 people, took place at a community centre in Southampton on February 21 - more than a month before Parliament was officially dissolved. He invited veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, who he described as a long-time friend. The former world number two and six-time World Champion, nicknamed 'The Whirlwind', played pool with residents, who were charged £2 to attend the event. 'I've known Jimmy as a friend for a number of years and so I asked him to come down and play pool with the kids,' Mr Rose said. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. 'I didn't want to make the event very Ukip so we put all the party banners away and everybody had a game of pool with Jimmy.' The Electoral Commission said the pastry provision was a police matter. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We have a received an allegation of "treating" by a prospective parliamentary candidate, contrary to the Representation of the People Act 1983. We are looking into the complaint. No arrests have been made.' Electoral Commission rules on treating state: 'A person is guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting. 'Treating requires a corrupt intent - it does not apply to ordinary hospitality.' Anyone found guilty of treating can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. Mr Rose has been a member of Ukip since 1999. He briefly stood as an independent in the key marginal Southampton Itchen seat in 2010 before pulling out. He is campaigning on tackling deprivation in Southampton, as well as wanting to pull the UK out of the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron came under criticism in the constituency earlier this week after sending a letter to residents spelling the constituency's name wrong three times. His letter, which has his letterhead and signature, had 'Itchen' spelled as 'Itchin', prompting the Conservatives to apologise for the embarrassing mistake. The constituency's MP has been Labour's John Denham since 1992. He held the seat in 2010 by just 192 votes and is standing down after May 7.

A husband was left so traumatised by his wife's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock, despite his wife already being given a hefty payout. In a case which could have huge financial consequences for the NHS, Julie Ronayne was awarded £160,000 after she was left 'looking like Michelin man' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008. Her husband Edward, who lives with Mrs Ronayne in Netherley, Liverpool, was awarded £9,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife's appearance. Edward Ronayne was given £9,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up 'like Michelin man' after botched surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital (pictured) The severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis, which the woman had contracted during the surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation. The test case, being heard at London's Appeal Court, could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an NHS mishap. Mr Ronayne was awarded the damages from Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust in July 2013. Liverpool County Court heard how he had been a 'secondary victim' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife's new appearance. He had described her 'colloquially as looking like a Michelin man', the court heard. Mr Ronayne also described his wife's first two days in hospital as 'the worst days of my entire life'. He said he had been 'brought up not to complain' but had never fully recovered from the sight. He added that he had been left feeling tearful, overwhelmed, angry and powerless. The judge, who described him as 'an honest and reliable witness', said: 'His symptoms...were pathological and went beyond simply the distress and anger that a man would suffer due to the near terminal illness of his wife.' But in the appeal court today, Charles Cory-Wright QC, who represents the health trust, told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury. He said Mr Ronayne's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims, costing the cash-strapped NHS millions in compensation. The barrister argued that Mr Ronayne would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation. He added that he was visiting his wife in hospital and therefore would have expected her to look unwell. He told the court: 'Hospitals on a day-to-day basis deal with people who are ill or vulnerable. They go there followed by their loved ones. It is unfortunately a matter of day-to-day occurrence that great emotional responses will take place in a hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if Mr Ronayne is allowed to keep the money. The test case is being heard at the appeal court . 'The question arises more and more often in cases like this as to whether those relatives have a claim.' Stressing the importance of the appeal, he told the judges: 'This appeal is not just about this case, but the concerns NHS Trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place. Peritonitis is caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the stomach. It is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, which can rapidly spread around the body. Peritonitis requires immediate treatment and is a medical emergency. Most cases of peritonitis are the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix or digestive disorders. Peritonitis can be fatal and needs to be treated quickly to avoid such complications. Source: NHS . 'The effect of this judgement, if it stands, is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases, as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock. 'Often emotional illness follows, but there is not the necessary element of shock. There needs to be a suddenly shocking event which, because of its shocking nature, causes that psychiatric illness. That is often lost in the wash in these cases.' But Lord Justice Sullivan said the incident had no doubt been 'shocking' 'Simply going into hospital and seeing one's loved ones and family looking peaky is not enough,' he said. 'But to see one's wife looking like the Michelin man is shocking.' Mr Cory-Wright then replied: 'If you saw your loved one looking like the Michelin man, swollen and all that, it would be shocking in an ordinary sense. 'But it would not be shocking in the sense of being suddenly overwhelmed so as to lead to psychiatric injury.' The judges recognised the importance of the case by reserving their decision on the trust's appeal until a later date. The case was heard in front of Lord Justice Sullivan, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Beatson. Mrs Ronayne went on to make a good recovery.

John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United with thousands of supporters planning to boycott Sunday's home match against Spurs. The 50-year-old has found himself the target of angry fans who are disillusioned with Mike Ashley’s running of the club. Results on the pitch – they have lost five on the spin - have not helped Carver’s cause, but the problems at Newcastle run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad. John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United . United’s supporters will protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from billionaire Ashley, especially as the Magpies have returned record profits of £18.7million and this week revealed they also have £34m sat in a bank account. Carver is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer – or deflect – questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis, distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul. But as reported by Sportsmail last month, senior sources within St James’ Park have indicated that Derby boss Steve McClaren will take over in the summer, regardless of whether or not the Rams are promoted from the Championship. On Tyneside, however, he will inherit what Carver believes is the toughest task in the land: ‘I think it is the hardest job in football, definitely,’ he said. Steve McClaren has already been tipped as a replacement for Carver should he face the Newcastle axe . ‘For me, this is the dream job, but you love it and hate it at the same time. ‘The hardest thing is taking the criticism off your own people. Some of it is deserved and some of it is not. ‘Sometimes you’re dealt the hand and you’ve got to get on with it and this is the hand I’ve been dealt. ‘When I took it on, if I hadn’t accepted then I would have been kicking myself. ‘And I’ve said this before, I genuinely believe that if I’ve got the right tools I can do the job. ‘But it is bitter sweet at the moment. This job is definitely a rollercoaster.’ Website AshleyOut.com are co-ordinating Sunday's planned boycott. They will protest outside of the Gallowgate End before kick-off and after the game. During the match they will go to Leazes Park behind the stadium. Carver, though, has urged fans to get behind the team. Fans are unhappy at how Newcastle are being run under Mike Ashley and have planned a boycott . ‘I would go to the match because I support the team,’ said Carver when asked if he would stay away as a supporter. ‘I think they (boycotters) do support the team but they have obviously got their own issues. I respect those issues. ‘I never thought I'd see this to be perfectly honest, especially in the North East of England because we love football. ‘So obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come, and I respect that.’ Carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against Tottenham Hotspur .

This is the moment when a not-so-little baby elephant seal emerged from the sea to give a surprised tourist one big cuddle. Charlene Fritz, 35, was visiting  Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula as part of an expedition when she made an unusual friend on the beach. Despite being no more than two months old, the elephant seal pup is still thought to have weighed around 200lbs, and Ms Fritz had a struggle sitting upright. Scroll down for video . One big cuddle: The elephant seal is thought to have been no more than two months old, but at a whopping 200lbs, Canadian tourist Charlene Fritz still struggled to reciprocate the hug . Making friends: Ms Fritz had the surprise of a lifetime when the baby elephant seal came out of the water for a cuddle during an expedition to Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula . Will you be my mummy? Elephant seal pups are abandoned by their mothers at just one month to learn how to take care of themselves . Charlene, from Saskatchewan, Canada, said: 'The seal climbed on top of me without hesitation. We shared a very sweet moment in time I will never forget. 'Her mouth was all pink inside and her eyes were amazing to look into. Like the deepest depths of the sea. I could have stared into her eyes forever.' She added: 'It was made very clear to me that I was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her. 'She came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up. I wanted to hug her so badly. 'Physically she felt like a big dough ball, super warm and like she had no bones. She did not smell of fish or have bad breath. She had never even eaten a fish at that point in her life. Rules: Ms Fritz explains that she badly wanted to hug the baby seal, but that regulations on the Antarctic expedition dictated that she in no way touch the pup . 'Sweet moment in time': Ms Fritz described the seal pup's eyes as being 'like the deepest depths of the sea' Crushing: Ms Fritz struggles to sit upright under the weight of the 200lbs baby elephant seal . Two young elephant selas have a rest on the shore of Snow Hill Island, Antarctic Peninsula . Charlene, whose 2011 encounter with the seal was filmed by a friend, had at first wondered why the seal was so friendly but later learned about the harsh weaning process. She said: 'Basically the mother fattens them up with her milk for a month or so, then abandons them on the beach. 'They have never been in the ocean to learn to fish or anything and basically lay there starving until they figure out to take the leap of faith and go into the sea. 'This is why they can be so sweet and looking for love, I guess.' However, an encounter with a full-grown elephant would have been a different prospect. Males of the species can weigh up to two tonnes and are known to have a nasty temper during mating season as the battle to control harems of females.

(CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are "conscientious objectors," and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new "no jab, no pay" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. "The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments," said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. "It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing," Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.

Many people might think that trust issues, long distances and cheating scandals are the biggest strains on a relationship. But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.

James Bond would have lasted just seven minutes into his last movie Skyfall before succumbing to fatal wounds from a uranium shot if the secret agent played by Daniel Craig was real. A group of medical experts watched the 23rd outing for Ian Fleming's hero and concluded that Bond would have been unlikely to survive to the end of the two hour film, and would have died or been critically injured several times . Within the first seven minutes, Bond is hit by a depleted uranium shell - an armour-piercing round normally used to destroy tanks that would almost certainly have killed the hero. Scroll down for video . James Bond would have died minutes into Skyfall - after being hit by a depleted uranium shell and then falling from a speeding train, where he could easily have severed his spine . As Bond fights in an icy loch he would have been likely to have died from the cold or lack of oxygen . In a feature for Total Film, the medical experts examine several different action movies to see whether the man characters would have survived their ordeal. Other movies to undergo the medical assessment were Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis. Unsurprisingly John McClane would not have survived. According to the experts, Bond's depleted uranium wound would have been fatal as it 'would have turned his lungs inside out and killed him'. In the unlikely event the massive round did not cause catastrophic injuries, the radioactive nature of the ammunition 'would greatly increase his cancer risk'. Bond cheats death throughout the two hour film, including when he is locked in a gunfight on the streets of Istanbul as he attempts to chase villain Patrice for a hard drive containing details of undercover agents . The hero effortlessly performs surgery on himself, but would have been likely to have lost too much blood . Not that growing old gracefully was ever likely for James Bond, who at one stage performs surgery on himself to remove a bullet, where he 'risks blood loss, lack of consciousness, nerve and muscle damage'. He also faces a significant risk of infection. Even jumping from the roof of a speeding train into a river presents its own risks, which probably should not be tried by ordinary members of the public as he would likely 'sever his spinal cord or break his neck'. 7 mins - Bond is shot in the chest by a depleted uranium bullet, likely to kill. If he had survived this the radioactive qualities of the ammunition would have increased his risk of cancer. 12 mins - The action hero is shot and then jumps from the roof of a speeding train into a river. The height of this fall would be likely to break his neck. 31 mins - After being shot Bond bravely removes a bullet from his shoulder. This DIY surgery would have led to significant blood loss as well as damaged his nerves and muscles. 2hrs - Bond fights in an icy loch. While the temperature alone would have presented problems, fighting underwater would have significantly depleted Bond's oxygen supply and could have caused him to drown. While James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 has survived since 1960, it is unlikely the man himself would have . However, filming the movie can prove slightly dangerous as Daniel Craig has recently required knee surgery after hurting himself while performing a stunt in his final Bond movie Spectre. Even Home Alone would have produced three fatalities. Marv and Harry would have likely died within hours of the movie's end while Kevin would have been killed within the first third of the film after falling from some shelves. However, Tom Hanks in Cast Away could have plausibly survived on a desert island for four years - as long as he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash. Although according to the experts, 76 per cent of the time he would have died in the accident. While Bruce WIllis' character in Die Hard, John McClane, pictured, would not have made it to the fourth movie . Tom Hanks in Castaway could have survived on the island - in the unlikely event he escaped the aircraft .

Need to have a difficult conversation with your other half or your boss? It might be a good idea to take them out to dinner. We get on better with each other over a meal, according to researchers who said it makes everyone from work colleagues to children seem more pleasant. Dutch and Canadian scientists asked nearly 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent at least five minutes talking to someone else. Well digested: Scientists have found people felt happier and more relaxed while eating at home or at work . About a fifth of the 1,000 meetings recorded took place over a meal, the journal Physiology and Behavior reports. On these occasions participants felt happier and more relaxed, whether at home, at work or elsewhere. They felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments and were more likely to make compromises. They also believed that the person they were with was warmer and more likeable. And hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. One possible explanation is that chewing raises levels of the ‘feel-good’ brain chemical serotonin. Food for thought: The study found that people can talk about tricky subjects far easier over a meal . It is also possible that shared meals enhance our inbuilt desire to be accepted and to please others. Marije aan het Rot, of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, said that tricky topics might be best tackled over a meal. Bosses and employees and also parents and children, might all find it easier to get on at the table while dinner may not be the best idea for a first date. Dr Rot said the people in her study knew each other and the effect of a sharing a meal might be different among strangers. Apart from anything else, meals can be lengthy and people meeting for the first time might struggle to come up with enough conversation.

Have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door, been woken by a Facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger? To deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies, one company has designed a range of prototype products. You can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product, funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Scroll down for video . Leeds-based Direct Line is running a competition called #EverydayFix. They asked groups to design products to deal with common problems. These include forgetting to lock the door, which one company hopes to solve with their Forget Me Lock prototype, shown . The products were designed as part of the Direct Line Everyday Fix design makeathon. They asked people to pick their top ten ‘everyday emergencies’ - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives. Groups from London-based design company Makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist. 1. Not being able to sleep (46 per cent*) 2. Losing your keys (37 per cent) 3. Being stuck in traffic when already late (35 per cent) 4. Losing an important paper or document (33 per cent) 5. Nowhere to park (32 per cent) 6. Printer not working when you need to print something (31 per cent) 7. Running out of battery on your phone whilst out (31 per cent) 8. Discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo (30 per cent) 9. Dealing with machine operated customer service (26 per cent) 10. Forgetting your bank card when paying for an item (25 per cent) *How many people thought this was a problem . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called ‘Snooze’, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep. To deal with not remembering if you had locked your door, ONN Studio created the Forget Me Lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door. It fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. This means that even when out or about, you can find out if your door is locked or not. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost. Direct Line is running a competition on Twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about Snooze, Forget Me Lock or Nipper. The Forget Me Lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key. When the key is turned in a lock it swivels green  to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost . The Nipper device (shown) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called Snooze, shown, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep . Whichever tweet has the most retweets, with the #EverydayFix hashtag, by 23 April will go into a Kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development. ‘We’ve seen the great British designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies,’ said Paul Smyth, co-founder of Makerversity. ‘Through the Direct Line Everyday Fix event, we’ve been able to extend our role as "fixers" and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation’s everyday emergencies,’ added John Shaw, head of R&D and Innovation at Direct Line. Of the products that didn’t make the cut, one was a helmet with ‘bone conduction headphones’ that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you. Another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space, which would then alert you when the space was free, if you couldn’t find somewhere to park. And as another solution to your phone running out of battery, one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies. Products that didn't make the final shortlist included the Parking Pin, shown. You could leave this in a parking space, and it will alert you when the space is free, so you can park your car . The Relay app, shown, would let you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies . And the 'Hat Nav' was a smart helmet that used ‘bone conduction headphones’ to give you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .

A cancer survivor who had to have part of his mouth removed after a tumour stopped him from swallowing has been given a new tongue made out of part of his arm. David Billing, 48, has told how he had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital, during which surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue. Medics then replaced the lost tissue with muscle from Mr Billing's arm. The only drawback is that it still has hairs on it, and he now has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved. David Billing, 48, had to have part of his tongue removed after being diagnosed with mouth cancer, so doctors made him a new one out of skin from his arm - which still has hairs on it . The dramatic story began after Mr Billing, a part-time welder, went to his GP in October 2013 after being unable to swallow. After a second doctor's appointment, he was referred to Royal Derby where specialists discovered an ulcer on the right-hand side of his tongue and confirmed it was cancer after a biopsy. He said: 'Being told I had cancer was mind-blowing and a real low point for me. I had no idea when they found this ulcer in my mouth that this was what it would be.' It was a double-blow for Mr Billing, as he had been made redundant just a week before from his job at digger manufacturer JCB. He said: 'It was all so overwhelming. My life and everything was ticking along nicely and the next thing I knew I'd lost my job and needed to have a major operation.' David had the procedure to remove the lump and rebuild his tongue on November 13, 2013. He said: 'I had to have a stomach tube fitted first and then go through the main procedure. Mr Billing was forced to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital (pictured), with surgeons sawing between two teeth and through his jaw to get to the tumour . 'They had to cut through the jawbone and get my face wide open to get to the ulcer then they had to remove some lymph nodes in my neck too, just to be safe in case the cancer had spread.' David spent nine days in hospital after his operation, returning now only for check-ups and once for the smaller procedure to reshape his tongue. He said: 'Usually, people have to go on chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the operation and, during this, the skin tissue used to rebuild the tongue shrinks in size. 'Because I didn't need either, it meant I later needed this smaller operation to have the bit of skin trimmed. 'My tongue's absolutely fine. I had to have speech therapy after the procedure but it's not had any long term impact on my speech or my eating or drinking.' David continued to use a feeding tube and relied on liquid foods until his first proper meal on Christmas Day 2013. And, in another fortunate turn of events, he was offered his old job a JCB back in March 2014. He added: 'JCB actually took me back having originally laid me off because of a lack of work. Mr Billing, who is now preparing to run the London Marathon to raise money for Cancer Research, says his speech is back to normal - though he does have to go to hospital to have his tongue shaved . 'It was the best feeling in the world when, two weeks after coming through the operation, the consultant told me the cancer was completely removed and I didn't even need radiotherapy or chemotherapy.' Now David is preparing to run the London Marathon and is hoping to raise more than £3,000 for cancer research. He said: 'I was not fit or well at all when I was watching the London Marathon last year but I thought how much I'd love to do it. 'I've never done anything like it before so, when I started feeling better, I decided to start training and now I'm about to take part in this experience of a lifetime. 'If I can get over the finish line, whatever time I do it in, it will be absolutely brilliant.'

The lovers who got the most complaints in New York City for loud sex are a handyman and the girlfriend he pops round for quickies with in the building where he works. The 25-year-old boytoy is the lover, of a Dominican woman in her late 30s, who invites him round for romps around her entire apartment in Brooklyn. The apartment block was named in a league table of complaints made to New York authorities about loud sex. Most complained: The building maintenance worker (left) and his girlfriend (right), who is now four months pregnant, were complained about six times for excessive noise at the Bay Ridge block, official records show . Say it loud: This is the apartment block with six calls made to 311 - New York city's non-emergency number - because of complaints of loud sex . Blue: The woman who was complained about was spoken to by police today. She later left, saying: 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone.' The woman whose moans during sex sparked the highest number of complaints in New York said today: 'I'm not hurting anyone'. The woman, who declined to give her name, walked out of the apartment block wearing striped maxi dres, a white jacket and sunglasses. She looked upset and said she was hurt by all the attention - and revealed she was pregnant. She said: 'I'm four months pregnant. 'I'm doing what I'm doing in my own apartment. I'm not hurting anyone. My neighbors calling the city are going about it the wrong way'. The league table, compiled by DNAInfo, showed that there were six complaints at the Bay Ridge block, which has 59 separate apartments. The outcome of the complaints was not recorded. Speaking to Daily Mail Online the boyfriend said that he didn't see what the problem was - and wouldn't mind if other people were as noisy as him. He outed himself after Daily Mail Online asked him and the building manager who had been making the complaints. The boyfriend said: 'I don't believe it because I'm the one who stays there. I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'. On the job: The building handyman complained about over noisy sex was at work today - at the apartment block where his girlfriend lives. House of noise: The apartment building is in Bay Ridge, close to New York harbor in Brooklyn . No idea: The building's owner Madelene Behefte told Daily Mail Online she had no idea about the complaints . No respite: The front door of the apartment at the center of six complaints for noisy sex. It failed to stop neighbors from overhearing the couple's antics . DNAInfo reported that New York's 311 helpline, for non-emergency complaints to city authorities, recorded a total of 133 complaints about loud sex between January 1 2014 and February 12 2015. Brooklyn, the borough now associated with trendy hipsters and home to would-be president Hillary Clinton's campaign, had the highest number of complaints, at 42. Brooklyn is the most populous of the city's five boroughs. Queens was next with 37, the Bronx and 31 and Manhattan had 23. Staten Island recorded none. The website reported that on November 14 last year, a 311 operator logged: 'Neighbors are having very loud sex with the windows open that can be heard throughout the whole bldg.' The complainant told the website the woman was 'moaning and screaming "Oh yeah, oh, do it to me".' It was followed by another woman shouting at the couple: 'Shut your f***ing windows you wh**e.' Complaints to 311 are passed to police to investigate if they are available, but officers found no noise disturbance when they attended the Bay Ridge block.

Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless. The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, José Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than £300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for. Pacquiao works up a sweat as he shadow boxes during preparations for his May 2 clash with Mayweather . With his eyes closed and grimacing with effort, Pacquiao ramps up his shadow boxing routine on Monday . On his toes and focused, Pacquiao is looking to defy the odds against fight favourite Floyd Mayweather . Roach kneels in the corner as Pacquiao's team prepare the eight-division champion for a session on the pads . The Filipino works his way around the ring, looking sharp after sharing a joke with Shapiro and Roach . Pacman limbers up ahead of his workout on Monday in the gym just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood . Pacquiao is going through his final preparations ahead of the bout billed as 'The Biggest Fight in History' Confident Pacquiao kicks his feet high during his warm-up ahead of training at Wild Card Boxing . There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight. Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout. 'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'

Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to quit because he was becoming increasing depressed watching cable news . Two months after announcing that he is leaving The Daily Show, Jon Stewart has revealed that he decided to call time on his 17 year reign because he was becoming increasing depressed by American politics and watching cable news. Speaking for the first time since making his shock decision, Stewart said he was looking forward to not having to watch the 'relentless' 24-hour news networks anymore. 'Watching these channels all day is incredibly depressing,' Stewart told The Guardian. 'I live in a constant state of depression. I think of us as turd miners. I put on my helmet, I go and mine turds, hopefully I don't get turd lung disease.' Asked if he'd ever voluntarily watch Fox News, Stewart said, 'Let's say that it's a nuclear winter, and I have been wandering, and there appears to be a flickering light through what appears to be a radioactive cloud and I think that light might be a food source that could help my family. 'I might glance at it for a moment until I realize, that's Fox News, and then I shut it off.' Stewart also confessed that his 'moments of dissatisfaction' with the show had started to become more frequent. 'It's not like I thought [The Daily Show] wasn't working any more, or that I didn't know how to do it. It was more, "Yup, it's working. But I'm not getting the same satisfaction,'" he said. 'These things are cyclical. You have moments of dissatisfaction, and then you come out of it and it's OK. But the cycles become longer and maybe more entrenched, and that's when you realize, "OK, I'm on the back side of it now.'" Scroll down for video . Stewart said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance in 2011 . Even the upcoming 2016 Presidential election campaign couldn't reignite Stewart's passion the way it once did. 'I'd covered an election four times, and it didn't appear that there was going to be anything wildly different about this one,' said Stewart. 'Honestly, it was a combination of the limitations of my brain and a format that is geared towards following an increasingly redundant process, which is our political process. 'I was just thinking, "Are there other ways to skin this cat?' And, beyond that, it would be nice to be home when my little elves get home from school, occasionally." Stewart also said he didn't have many regrets from his time hosting the Comedy Central show, but one was not pushing Donald Rumsfeld harder when he had the chance. The former secretary of defense appeared on The Daily Show in 2011 for an interview, which the comedian says he messed up. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, left, would be taking over . 'He just went into the general gobbledegook,' said Stewart. "Mnah mnah mnah, well, you have to remember, it was 9/11 mnah mnah." I should have pushed, but he's very adept at deflecting.' Rumsfeld, who was on the show to promote his memoir, Known And Unknown, dodged Stewart's questions about faulty U.S. intelligence leading up to the Iraq War. Although Stewart hasn't set an official exit date, Comedy Central announced last month that comedian and The Daily Show correspondent Trevor Noah, 31, would be taking over. Noah has already had to combat  accusations of anti-Semitism over a series of old tweets. Stewart has voiced his full support for his successor, recently calling the incoming host 'incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart.' The exiting host told The Guardian that one reason for  stepping down early in the presidential election cycle was to give Noah a big story to tackle. Stewart said he felt 'that, for the show, you don't want to leave when the cupboard's bare. So I think it's a better introduction when you have something providing you with assisted fuel, like a presidential campaign.'

An eight-grade girl accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in adult jail while awaiting trial, a judge. A defense petition to return 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek to the juvenile facility where she was initially sent after the body of 54-year-old Cheryl Silvonek was discovered last month was denied by Lehigh County Judge Maria Dantos on Friday. District Attorney Jim Martin had opposed the petition on behalf of the teenager, who is charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy. Her boyfriend, Caleb Barnes, 20, who is from El Paso, Texas, but was stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, is charged with homicide. JamieSilvonek, the eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, it was ruled on Friday . Cheryl Silvonek's body was found with stab wounds in a shallow grave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and her vehicle partially submerged in a pond a few miles from the family home. Jamie Silvonek was sent to the county jail this month after she was charged as an adult and is in the women's housing unit, away from older inmates, county officials said. Authorities said Barnes and the teenager met in October, when she was 13, but she told him she was 17. Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. The teen's mother found out about their relationship in early March and ordered them to end it. A day later, the teen told Barnes in a text message, 'I want her gone,' police said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. The 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. 14-year-old JamieSilvonek allegedly conspired to kill her mother Cheryl Silvonek with her 20-year-old boyfriend 'because she disapproved of their relationship' Barnes confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, and that given the age disparity 'there has to be some type of duress or coercion'. He said his client 'cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom' and she feared for her life and that of her father. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life . Police found the body of Cheryl Silvonek in a shallow grave a few miles from her home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby .

Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed for a year after orchestrating a scam to steal £15,000 of goods from the Asda in Basildon, Essex, where he worked . An Asda manager orchestrated a scam that used the supermarket's own delivery service to steal goods worth more than £15,000 - then managed to land a job at Lidl after he was sacked. Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed after running the scam where stock including alcohol, cigarettes, DVDs, computer games and consoles were taken from the store in Basildon, Essex, where he worked. Southend Crown Court heard how the conspiracy was uncovered, following a period during which Gridley and colleague Jay Reed were under suspicion. Thomas Daniel, prosecuting, told the court that goods, ranging from televisions to baby formula, were delivered to Reed's address and presumably sold on. He said: 'Two anonymous reports were received by Asda, one of which suggested Mr Gridley was involved in selling items believed to have been stolen, such as TVs and baby formula. 'When Mr Gridley was ill for a certain period of time, those deliveries stopped, and when he recovered they started again. 'Another email suggested stolen goods being delivered to the address of Mr Gridley's cousin.' But shockingly, after being sacked from the store, Gridley managed to land a managerial role at Lidl in Romford, Essex. Gridley, who was former home shopping manager of the store, was sentenced to 12 months for his leading role in a conspiracy to steal £15,852.46 worth of goods between November 2013 and April last year. The court heard that Reed and another defendant James Munyard had been pressured into taking part in the scam by Gridley, who was their superior. Stock including alcohol, cigarettes were taken from shelves and delivered to addresses using the supermarket's own home delivery service. File photo . Section leader Reed, 23, and Munyard, 21, both avoided prison, but were given suspended sentences of eight and four months, respectively. Mitchell Cohen, representing Munyard, told the court that his client, whose role was confined to taking items off shelves and putting them in a crate, had attempted to be transferred from the store in order to escape Gridley's control. James Munyard (pictured) avoided jail for his part in the scam . Reed was deemed to have been in a position of trust and responsibility in the criminal enterprise, but Recorder Gerard Pounder said he had a lesser role than Gridley, 26, and Munyard even less so. Despite hearing Gridley, of Tilbury,  financially supported his former partner and their two-year-old child but also his own father and grandparents, Recorder Pounder said he had no choice but to send him to prison. He said: 'You were in a position of supreme trust and you say you started this because of threats made regarding a drug debt of your cousin's, you continued even as those threats faded, and brought other people in, too.' Sentencing Reed to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 200 hours' unpaid work, he said: 'You were in a lesser role than Mr Gridley but you were a section leader and had responsibilities. 'In that respect you were somebody who knew the system and it was to your premises these items were taken - without that and your part in the enterprise, it would not have worked.' Munyard, who Mr Cohen said 'didn't have the spine to stand up to what he was being asked to do,' was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, and 100 hours' unpaid work. A spokesperson for Lidl told MailOnline they are unable to comment until an internal investigation has been conducted.

The 14-time major champion is bidding to win his fifth green jacket, but has been plagued by a succession of injuries and even the chipping yips in recent times. The world will find out which version of Woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48pm. Defending champion Bubba Watson, hoping to win his third Masters title in four years, will tee off at 2.24pm alongside England's former US Open champion Justin Rose and 21-year-old South Korean amateur Gunn Yang, who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the US Amateur last year. Those watching the 2.02pm group on Thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game's most colourful characters go head-to-head. Ian Poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet, but even he might meet his match in American young gun Patrick Reed, who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at Doral last year. He followed that up by shushing the home crowd during a cocksure display at Gleneagles. Three-time Masters champion Phil MIckelson, hitting from behind trees during practice, will play alongside McIlroy in the first two rounds . Ryan Moore, pictured during a practice round at Augusta, will join McIlroy and Mickelson on the course for round one and two . Woods will be accompanied with Wales' Jamie Donaldson and Jimmy Walker of the USA during the first two rounds of the competition . US Open champion Martin Kaymer is in the group behind world No 1 McIlroy, with Brandt Snedeker and Houston Open winner JB Holmes. McIlroy and Mickelson were among the players battling for the US PGA title in near-darkness at Valhalla last year, with Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light. With 98 players in the field, Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45pm (7:45am local time), with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier, the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while Arnold Palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder. England's Danny Willett will begin his Masters debut in the second group at 12:56pm alongside 1987 winner Larry Mize and US amateur public links champion Byron Meth. Woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth Masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round. The American superstar has started just two events in 2015, carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second, but said he was ready to 'compete to win a golf tournament' after 11 holes of practice on Monday. The final group tees off at 1:59pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world, Australia's Jason Day, Spain's Sergio Garcia and Fowler. Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors last year.

A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by £345 to £975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from £870 to £1,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices . The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from £870 to £1,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game . Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay £345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost £975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season . Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.

A pregnant mother with a rare form of dwarfism has revealed the physical challenges of raising her three-year-old son - who is more than half her size - while preparing for the arrival of her second child. Tiffanie DiDonato, from Swansboro, North Carolina, was born with diastrophic dysplasia and underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries as a child so she would grow to be 4'10 tall, instead of her previous height of 3'8, which is how tall her son Titan currently is. But even with the additional inches, parenting a rambunctious toddler can be difficult for the 34-year-old mom who has certain physical limitations, and often has to use crutches, or sometimes a wheelchair, in addition to being three months pregnant. 'Titan is a typical kid – he wants to do what he wants to do,' she told People of her son. 'And chasing him outside or across the street is not an option for me.' Helping hand: Tiffanie DiDonato, who has diastrophic dysplasia, a rare form of dwarfism, can be seen grocery shopping with her three-year-old son Titan, who is more than half her size, but always willing to assist her . Making it work: The 34-year-old mom from Swansboro, North Carolina, is 4'10 tall and is constantly re-teaching herself to walk because of the stiff muscles and arthritis, which are side effects of her dwarfism . Tiffanie, who married to Eric Gabrielse, a 6’1, 29-year-old Marine who is 6'0, explained that she has to get creative when it comes to dealing with her son - especially when he throws himself on the floor and cries. When tantrums occurs she will walk way and say: 'Mommy can't help when you're yelling at me... No crying and Mommy can help.' Tiffanie noted that this trick, which she has developed over time, usually prompts her son to get up and give her a hug. 'I try my best to let him know throwing tantrums doesn't get you very far - a great lesson to learn, don't you think?' she said. Great news: Tiffanie and her husband Eric Gabrielse, a 29-year-old Marine, are expecting their second child in September . All smiles: Titan happily cuddled up to his dad for this snapshot . Full of life: The three-year-old had a laugh while his dad Eric enjoyed his breakfast . Tiffanie, who co-wrote the memoir Dwarf with Rennie Dyball, has difficulty lifting Titan now that is getting taller because her arms are significantly shorter than most moms. The stiff muscles and arthritis that are side effects of her condition mean that she has to constantly re-teach herself how to walk - which makes chasing after Titan impossible. Losing control of her son is one of her greatest fears, which is why she avoids leaving the house with Titan when she doesn’t her husband Eric or another family member by her side. 'I have even watched Eric struggle to catch him outside and he's a Marine!' she explained. ‘We named Titan correctly, because he's almost too speedy and too athletic.' Because she 'wouldn't stand a chance' against outracing her son, she makes sure she stays '10 steps ahead of the game' at all times. Overcoming obstacles: Tiffanie can be seen as a child wearing braces on her legs. She underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries when she was younger . Painful choice: Tiffanie was expected to be 3'8 tall, but her surgeries allowed her to grow to 4'10, enabling her to be more independent . Tiffanie recalled times in which Titan has climbed into the dryer or wedged himself behind the couch or plopped himself inside the sink. Without physically being able to get him out on her own, she has to rely on her own quick thinking, as well as game she made up to ensure his cooperation. She explained that when she sings: 'One, two, three, help me!' and reaches out for Titan, he will take her hands and pull himself up and out of whatever precarious situation he has gotten himself into. Titan's willingness to lend his mom a helping hand is one of the reasons she is confident that he will be a fantastic big brother. 'He really is - whether he is intentionally doing so or no - becoming my little helper,' she said. 'We conquer the day-to-day challenges together, and I hope we always do.' Sweet moment: Tiffanie and Titan snuggled up together on the couch before he fell asleep . Support system: Tiffanie wore a yellow halter dress while posing for this photo with a friend . Sports fans: Eric and Tiffanie smiled for the camera at a Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium in New York City .

An Old Bailey judge has blasted his junior colleague for ‘taking his eye off the ball’ and passing an 'unlawful' sentence when letting a BT manager dodge jail for a £28,000 expenses scam. Wheelchair-bound  Christopher Starrs, 50, was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in January after admitting his part in a two-and-a-half year con against his employer BT. Starrs, along with fellow BT Openreach manager Phillip Tamplin, invented clamped cars, overtime hours and damage to home owners’ property during broadband installation, and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims. Blasted: Judge Nicholas Cooke QC (left) blasted his junior colleague Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC (right) for 'taking his eye off the ball' when he sentenced Christopher Starrs in January this year . Both Starrs and Tamplin, 53, who made £124,000 from the con, admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses. Tamplin was jailed for two years at January's sentencing hearing, but Mr Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC spared Starrs jail as an ‘act of mercy’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £1,500 fine. However, senior Judge Nicholas Cooke QC has now said the sentence was ‘unlawful’ - and added Starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes. ‘It was an unlawful sentence passed and now I need to do something to put it right, because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter,’ he said. ‘He was mercifully dealt with, sadly by a judge who didn’t have his eye on the ball.’ The judge told Mark Haslam, defending: ‘The sentence was wrong but that’s a matter of personal opinion. ‘Your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison. ‘What the Recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn’t available to him. ‘No one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on Mr Starrs was unlawful. ‘I am sorry to be the headmaster but we really don’t want this sort of thing.’ Fraud: Wheelchair-bound Starrs, 50, was a manager with BT who admitted defrauding the company of £28,000 over two years . The Recorder, who is the head of 4 Bream Buildings chambers and took the Silk in 2006, gave Starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine, and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue. But Judge Cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order. Turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing, he added: ‘This is supposed to be a centre of excellence, when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and can’t do. ‘The judge should have been told what his powers were.’ Prosecutor John Ojakovoh said Starrs offered a ‘blank cheque’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £28,000 he stole. After the judge heard the CPS will now drop the confiscation proceedings, he said the original sentence will stand, quipping: ‘He no doubt thanks his lucky stars.’ Both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time. The main fraudulent claim was for BT vehicles which had been ‘clamped’ by parking authorities. BT Openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work. The company pays out around £1million in fines in London alone every year. Starrs and Tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates. Sentencing Recorder Trimmer, who has led a string of high-profile Serious Fraud Office prosecutions in the last two years, said: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time. ‘It involved over 100 or so false claims, made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity. ‘Both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity. ‘You both knew how it could be conducted, concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally.’ Starrs, of Northolt, Middlesex, who had worked at BT since 1988, was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair. He was not at court today due to a mix-up over whether he was required to attend.

A forensic psychiatrist has testified that Lou Gehrig's disease is the reason a former sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his wife and sister-in-law, whom the defendant described in a suicide note as his threesome partners. Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.

The US body that regulates Internet addresses is looking to crack down on a Canadian company using the new '.sucks' domain name to extract exorbitant sums from celebrities such as Kevin Spacey and companies looking to protect their reputations. So far, purchased names include Youtube.sucks, Bing.sucks, Visa.sucks, Bankofamerica.sucks, Yahoo.sucks, Telusmobility.sucks and other major brand names. Kevin Spacey has reportedly paid have his his '.sucks' domain taken down. Kevin Spacey is reportedly among celebrities paying out to have their name removed from one of the  '.sucks' domains which opened on 30 March . Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains attacking her, CNBC reported. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or 'ICANN,'  sent a letter on Thursday to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Office of Consumer Affairs to see if the actions of company Vox Populi Registry Ltd. were illegal. ICANN initially approved of the so-called top-level domain name, among nearly 600 it has added recently to expand beyond common names such as '.com,' '.org' and '.us.' But it is backtracking after an advisory panel made up of industry groups and companies like Microsoft, Verizon and eBay complained last month. Vox Populi began accepting registrations using '.sucks' on March 30 from trademark holders and celebrities before it is released to public applicants. Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains . It has recommended charging $2,499 a year for the privilege, and according to Vox Populi CEO John Berard, most of the names have been sold by resellers for around $2,000 a year. Berard has said the domain name is meant to create destinations for companies to interact with their critics and called his company's business 'well within the lines of ICANN rules and the law.' Two weeks ago, the advisory body called the Intellectual Property Constituency representing major companies and industry groups asked ICANN in a letter to halt the rollout of '.sucks,' calling it a 'shakedown scheme' and 'predatory.' Companies like GoDaddy.com register some domain names for just $1 a year, and Vox Populi will offer consumers the right to secure a '.sucks' address for just $10 a year starting in September. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme.' ICANN said in its letter that if Canadian or U.S. regulators find Vox Populi's actions are illegal, it could declare the company in breach of its contract and seek to change the registry's behavior. It said it is also seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme .

The semi-final line-up for the Champions League has been confirmed and, although there may be no English involvement, four European giants are just three games from being crowned champions of the continent in Berlin on June 6. With Real Madrid and Juventus winning on Wednesday to join Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the last four, this season's competition is one of the toughest to call in recent memory. We asked our team of reporters who they think will win this season's Champions League. SAMI MOKBEL - Barcelona . Momentum is key at this point in the season and Barcelona are in overdrive. Their early-season woes are a distant memory and Luis Enrique is finally getting his point across. Lionel Messi remains phenomenal and a certain Luis Suarez is hitting top gear just at the right time. Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left) , Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) NEIL ASHTON - Bayern Munich . They overcame their blip (the rip in the seam of Pep's trousers) to power their way beyond Porto in the second leg of the quarter-final and remind everyone just how good they are. They have much to prove after last season's disappointment but they are a phenomenal team. I expect them to draw Barcelona in the semi-final. Bayern Munich produced a stunning display in the second leg to beat Porto in the quarter-finals . JOE BERNSTEIN - Barcelona . Bayern and Barcelona are both better teams than Juventus or Real Madrid and to separate them is nigh on impossible. But given the backroom strife at Bayern, particularly over Arjen Robben's injury, I'd narrowly go for Messi and Barcelona ending their four-year Champions League 'drought'. DOMINIC KING - Barcelona . To think at the start of the season, after Real Madrid pummelled them in the first Clasico, that we thought the beginning of the end had started. Now they look majestic once more and the front three of Messi, Neymar and Suarez gives them an edge over all their rivals. Hopefully it will be a straight shootout between them and Bayern Munich in Berlin. This is the best Champions League semi-final line-up ever and we might get the spectacular final to go with it. LEE CLAYTON - Juventus . Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba and Gianluigi Buffon -  experience, goals and know-how. Tevez isn't Messi (or Cristiano Ronaldo), Pogba isn't Thomas Muller and Buffon isn't Manuel Neuer: Yes, they are ugly bugs on a catwalk of super powers, but they CAN win this. After all, Denmark and Greece both won the Euros. Juventus celebrate their 1-0 aggregate victory over Monaco in the last eight of the Champions League . Juventus striker Carlos Tevez leads the scoring in Serie A this season with 18 goals . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI - Barcelona . Since it's been established that we don't live in a post-Messi (48 goals in 49 starts) world I can't bring myself to bet against him. Would love to see them in a final against Bayern Munich. CHRIS WHEELER - Bayern Munich . After that crushing 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the semi-finals a year ago, and the shock of suffering a 3-1 first-leg loss to Porto in this season’s quarters, expect the real Bayern to stand up and deliver another Champions League triumph for Guardiola. Is it written in the stars that Barcelona will be standing in his way? LAURIE WHITWELL - Barcelona . The front three of Messi, Suarez, and Neymar are beginning to click to devastating effect and the magical allure of Barcelona is returning. It would be some turnaround from the disputes and disappointments of early season, but this is a team full of players who know how to win the trophy. Neymar scored both goals in Barcelona's 2-0 second-leg victory over Paris Saint-Germain at the Nou Camp . LAURA WILLIAMSON - Real Madrid . They might be depleted by injuries but experience and pedigree count in this competition and, as we saw against Atletico Madrid, you can never count against the 10-time winners. Or, indeed, a certain Ronaldo. Javier Hernandez's 88th-minute winner saw Real Madrid edge past their local rivals Atletico Madrid . Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League title and a second in a row with Real Madrid . ROB DRAPER - Bayern Munich . Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben are on the way back, Pep  has a point to prove and the team have the memory of that awful semi-final against Real Madrid last year to drive them on. As long as they don't take their foot off the gas having already won the Bundesliga, they'll make good the disappointment of last year. Robert Lewandowski celebrates one of five first-half goals Bayern Munich scored against Porto on Tuesday . JACK GAUGHAN - Barcelona . I'm tempted to say Bayern Munich but they've got similar buckling deficiencies to the Barcelona we've seen recently. By contrast, the Catalans have found their misplaced defensive steel, have a coach whose win percentage eclipses all to precede him and - well - possess Messi. And Neymar. And Suarez. SAM CUNNINGHAM - Bayern Munich . I would back Guardiola to outwit any of the remaining managers in the tournament with the players at his disposal. Some were writing Bayern Munich off after their 3-1 first-leg defeat by Porto and look how that went. Everyone talks about Messi and Ronaldo, but the collective force of Bayern players is frightening. OLIVER TODD - Barcelona . After a difficult start to the season they've hit form at the right time. Enrique has found a way to get the front three of Messi,  Suarez and Neymar to fire and even if you can keep two of them quiet - as Paris Saint-Germain did on Tuesday - the other will make you pay.

Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.

Steve Davis would love to see Jimmy White and Reanne Evans light up the Crucible stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn. The king of the baize in the 1980s believes the Whirlwind and the doyenne of the women's tour face tall orders to get through qualifying for the Betfred World Championship. Evans saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion Ken Doherty on Thursday, in the first of three preliminary rounds, while White will tackle fellow veteran James Wattana in his opener on Saturday. Steve Davis will attempt to qualify for this year's Betfred World Championship at the Crucible . But Davis, who will also attempt to qualify, expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in Sheffield. He calls 29-year-old Dudley potter Evans 'a great player', and said of the 10-time ladies' world champion: 'It's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods. It's a bun fight, but she's perhaps the best woman player I've ever seen. 'In the 1980s I saw Allison Fisher who was the best around, and she was an excellent, excellent player but more methodical. 'Reanne is more like the Jimmy White or the Ronnie O'Sullivan of the women's game. She has the feel for the game, she's at one with the table. 'She could cause a surprise, but to win three matches is the tough bit. It's hard enough for me and Jimmy. 'If me or Jimmy qualify for the Crucible, it's arguably as big a win as we've ever had. 'I've got a little bit of a desire to do it, but Jimmy would certainly love to get back to the Crucible.' Reanne Evans takes on Ken Docherty for a place at the World Championships in Sheffield . Reanne Evans is a 10-time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010-11 season. She suffered 18 consecutive defeats however and failed to qualify the following year. White, who lost six World Championship finals, last appeared at the tournament in 2006, and has fallen short in qualifying every year since. While 52-year-old White is in the autumn of his career, for Davis these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down. He turns 58 in August and fell off the main tour 12 months ago. A memoir, Interesting, hits the bookshelves on Thursday. A tricky qualifying opener against Jamie Cope could end in disappointment, but it would be short-lived. 'I can't build up the intensity that I used to have, but I must admit I'm getting excited about pitting my wits against another generation of players,' Davis said. 'Of course, it'll all end in tears. 'I'm not totally committed but I still have the juices running through me a little bit. I've been practising but it's not a pretty sight. They're wobbling more in the pockets before saying 'nope'. 'Whether I get to the TV stages, that's a long shot. That's tough. Jimmy White will take on fellow veteran James Wattana in qualifying on Thursday . 'I was still practising hard even when I wasn't getting to the latter stages of the Crucible, and in the end you have to say, 'Yeah, I've tried, but the price is too much investment of time'. 'Now if I've lost a match, by the time I've got in the car I've thought about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day, rather than beating up the person who's come up with me. 'I think it's been a bit like Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I'm sure in the night that someone swapped me for a more mellow version.' Davis won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament, but the 1985 'black-ball final' defeat to Dennis Taylor stands over and above all memories. Dennis Taylor in action during the memorable 1985 World Championship final against Davis . The second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant Davis having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again. 'I don't remember anything as much as I remember the '85 final,' Davis said. 'I do remember the last frame, more so because I've watched it through on video a few times. 'My career was a blur and all games and matches blur into one in the end, it's only the strange moments that do stick in your brain.'

(CNN)Is America a nation divided?  And has Ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions? It's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation: immigration, community and police relations, poverty, education and dozens of other crucial matters facing America. Adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite, and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country. In Ohio, we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services, criminal justice, economic competiveness, infrastructure -- and I've enjoyed sharing our state's winning formula with others in my travels. In 2011, I returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in Congress in the 1980s and '90s.  Over the intervening years, Ohio had lost its way and was hurting. I felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 Ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet. Ohio is much stronger today. And that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing. For example, we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation's strongest state budgets and a nearly $2 billion surplus. We've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones. We've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in America, including tax cuts for the working poor. We're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and Ohio's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade. Getting Ohio back on track wasn't easy. It required big ideas, going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests. Yes, we have a great success story to tell about our state. And we need to make Ohio's success contagious. The leadership style that helped us turn around Ohio is needed in Washington, where America's $18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting Mother's Day if it required their action. Great leaders are not primarily guided by polls, political parties, focus groups, re-election, special interests or protecting the status quo. Instead they bring teams of people together, challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee in Congress in the 1990s, I helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. We worked in a bipartisan effort that doesn't happen enough. There were, of course, disagreements along the way, but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means. Given the polarizing issues facing our country, America needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego, selfishness and power produce. Leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets, tax cuts, welfare reform, border security, immigration and health care. We see it every day. There are certain values that guide great countries: . • Personal responsibility: It obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities. • Empathy: It allows us to walk in someone else's shoes, so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another, better way that makes all of us stronger. • Teamwork: It sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win. • Faith: It tells us we are made special in the image of God with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth. These values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all Americans instead of producing rhetoric, sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform. In Ohio we've implemented this winning strategy. It's worked there, and it will work for the nation as well.

A tortoise has been reunited with his owner after spending nearly a year on the run and even finding a new home - at the age of 109. Owner Wendy Stokes, 74, had given up hope of ever seeing Toby again after he escaped from her garden 11 months ago. But he has now returned home and after piecing together his escapades over the last year, it's become apparent he's had quite an adventure. Reunited: Wendy Stokes, 74, is delighted to have 109-year-old Toby back after his escape 11 months ago . He wandered through a gate in her garden and headed for the open road where he was picked up by a passing driver concerned for his safety and taken to a nearby animal rescue centre. Six months ago, he was re-homed with a couple living in Margate, Kent, 22 miles away from Wendy's farm in West Hougham. But the couple, who could just about make out the word 'Stokes' written in white paint on his shell, felt they needed to find out who Tony belonged to. With nothing else to go on, they decided to call every Stokes in Kent listed in the phonebook. Eventually came across a delighted Wendy, who immediately arranged to collect him. She's had Toby since the 1980s when he was given to her by her late great aunt. He was returned home last Sunday, a full 11 months after his amazing, if a little slow, adventure. Wendy has had Toby since the 1980s and wrote her surname, Stokes, on his back in white paint . Retired farm worker Wendy said: 'I had painted my name and number on the side of his shell but it had faded when he went missing so they couldn't read it. 'The people who found him could read Stokes but they couldn't make out the number. 'He had got out because I had left my gate open. It is normally closed because we have sheep in the paddock but they were in a different field. 'Toby just walked out and trotted towards the road where somebody picked him up and took him to a rescue centre. 'Everyone knows I have a tortoise and we always take him to the village fete so he is a bit of a local celebrity. 'I was devastated when he went missing and spent weeks looking for him in all the fields around the farm.' She added: 'I went all goosey when they told me they had Toby because I had really given up on him. 'It is brilliant having him back and I think everybody was keeping their eye out for him all this time.'

A vicious swan known for terrorising punters and kayakers on the River Cam is now believed to have a grandson following in his footsteps. The savage swan nicknamed Asbaby, which still has many brown baby feathers, has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the Cambridge river. Mr Asbo, the swan believed to be his grandfather, was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 by river authorities after repeatedly attacking rowers. Scroll down for video . Watch out: Savage swan Asbaby has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the river in Cambridge over the Easter weekend . Up close: One resident who lives near the river said Asbaby 'sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers' Theft: Asbaby was seen attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag (above) Capturing the moment: Asbaby (pictured) is believed to be the grandson of Mr Asbo, who was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 . Pecking at the punters: The swan on the River Cam is said to be even more vicious than his father, Asboy, and grandfather, Asbo . Asbaby was seen at the weekend attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman’s handbag. He is said to have inherited his bad temper from his grandfather, and his father Asboy, who conducted a reign of terror on the river last summer. Harry Crossell, 65, who lives near the river, said: ‘He is even more vicious than his father and grandfather. '(He) sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers. I’ve seen him chasing after punts and taking their picnics. 'Once I even saw him put his beak around a bottle of champagne. ‘It’s terrifying for river users and it’s making people think twice about going out on the water.’ Another resident, Simon Patterson, 52, said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour would get worse as he gets older. ‘The swan is only young at the moment, we’re concerned he will get stronger and more vicious as he grows bigger,’ he said. Shock: The swan got up close with this woman, whose surprise at what was unfolding in front of her could clearly be seen (right) Making an appearance: The juvenile swan nicknamed Asbaby got far too close for comfort to tourists on the Cam over the Easter weekend . Naughty swan: One resident said locals were worried Asbaby’s behaviour on the River Cam would get worse as he gets older . ‘He swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way. We thought Mr Asbo and Asboy were bad, but this swan is even worse. ‘It’s very worrying as the river is starting to get busier now, if he continues someone could get really hurt.’ But Colin Sparkes, navigation officer for Conservators of the River Cam, told MailOnline today: ‘Most swans get a bit aggressive this time of year. ‘It's mating season - they protect their territory. As far as I’m aware, it's not causing great problems on the river. ‘Swans this time of year start to look out for their nest, and indeed when the young and born. ‘It’s a very tricky one because the more people feed the swans, the more aggressive they tend to become. Close to the camera: Asbaby 'swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way', according to one local resident . Worrying: Asbaby's actions are said to be 'terrifying for river users' and are 'making people think twice about going out on the water' Threatening: The behaviour of Mr Asbo (above) before he was moved 60 miles three years ago left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises . No longer there: The Cam Conservators moved Mr Asbo about 60 miles away in 2012. His son Asboy is seen above in this file photograph . 'They get used to swimming up to people expecting to be fed.’ He confirmed that there are no plans to remove Asbaby from the river, adding that the case of Mr Asbo was completely different. Mr Sparkes said: ‘That swan (Mr Asbo) was extremely aggressive - it's the most aggressive swan I've ever come across. ‘I believe that was probably down to the way he'd been brought up looking for food from various people.’ The Conservators moved Mr Asbo away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself. His behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises - and a marshal was employed during a university rowing race to stop him injuring students. It has previously been reported how Asboy was seen attacking punters, birds and even a cow. He also injured a canoeist and a swimmer.

The Conservative know that they need to turn large parts of the country blue on May 7. And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate Alec Shelbrooke in Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.

After months of speculation - and years of her friends' doubts - Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has admitted she never had cancer. With her business empire destroyed and her online community in tatters, Gibson today admitted her fatal cancer 'diagnoses' were lies. 'No. None of it is true,' she said, during a series of interviews published in the latest edition of the Australian Women's Weekly. In the interviews - which questioned her relationship with the truth and her understanding of cancer - Gibson said she was not seeking forgiveness. 'I don't want forgiveness. I just think (it) was the responsible thing to do. Above anything, I would like people to say, 'Okay, she's human'. Gibson's confession was the first time she has spoken publicly since - under fire from furious former fans - she told Daily Mail Australia she feared for her family's safety. Scroll down for video . Ms Gibson revealed the truth of her cancer diagnosis in an interview . Ms Gibson, pictured kissing her son Olivier, 4, on the head, said: 'None of it was true' Her business empire in tatters and her relationship with her fans broken, Ms Gibson is thought to be struggling financially. The Women's Weekly said she was not paid for her interview . Ms Gibson's interview will be published in this month's edition of the Australian Women's Weekly . The wellness blogger was a prominent Australian social media personality. Her Instagram fan base ballooned after she 'revealed' she had prolonger her life by embracing an alternative lifestyle. Her 'whole foods' business became famously successful. Penguin published her recipe book and her app was to be offered on the Apple Watch. But it all fell apart last month after revelations emerged Ms Gibson had failed to fulfil promised donations to various charities. Friends then began to cast doubts about her cancer diagnoses. She then tearfully 'admitted' she may have been 'misdiagnosed' by a 'Dr Phil'. The  Weekly insists it did not pay for the story and that it was approached by Ms Gibson's 'people', the Melbourne 'corporate advisory' firm Bespoke Approach. Ms Gibson said her partner, Clive Rothwell, was sticking by her in spite of the controversy. But she said he had taken a 'stern' line with her and insisted she play a straight bat. 'He’s been very stern, along the lines of, ‘I just want you to acknowledge where you’ve f***ed up and try not to smooth over that,' she was quoted saying. In the article, titled 'My Lifelong Struggle With The Truth', Ms Gibson also said she had been forced to raise herself from the day she started school. She said she took upon common household responsibilities, such as bringing her brother to school and making lunches. But she would not provide her mother's name or contact details to the magazine. In her previous interview, Ms Gibson said she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion'. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) was also a popular app. It will not appear on the Apple Watch any longer . But she took aim at many of her former fans who she believed had responded 'maliciously' - claiming that her son's childcare details, home address and floor plan were published online. Former friends had called upon Ms Gibson to 'come clean' with the truth about her situation and had long privately questioned the veracity of her story. Authorities told Daily Mail Australia  at the beginning of April that Ms Gibson is still facing an official investigation. A former friend of Ms Gibson directly called on her to 'come clean' in an interview with Daily Mail Australia in March. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want'

A ‘unique and beautiful’ teenage girl was killed by a driver who crashed a stolen car while drunk and high on cocaine and cannabis. Xana Doyle, 19, was a passenger in the Toyota Avensis, which flipped and landed on its roof in an accident in the early hours of the morning. Driver Sakhawat Ali, 23, was more than twice the drink-drive limit and had been taking class A and B drugs before getting behind the wheel. Xana Doyle (pictured) was killed after driver Sakhawat Ali crashed a stolen car while high on drugs . The Toyota Avensis flipped and landed on its roof after the crash in the early hours of the morning in January . A court heard he was driving at ‘excessive speed’ in the moments before the crash, which did not involve any other vehicle. Miss Doyle, who suffered a ‘blunt head injury’, was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales. Ali admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday. Judge Neil Bidder QC told the court: ‘The driver was well over twice the drink-drive limit and it is accepted there was excessive speed.’ The judge said he wanted more information on how much cocaine and cannabis the driver had taken on the night of the smash before sentencing. Ali, of Newport, was remanded in custody ahead of a hearing in July. Sakhawat Ali (pictured right) admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking . The driver’s cousin, Shabaz Ali, 21, admitted allowing himself to be carried in a stolen car following the smash in January this year. The July hearing will decide whether he ‘contributed’ to the accident by pulling the handbrake from the back seat. Floral tributes were left at the scene of the accident and hundreds of people attended the funeral of Miss Doyle, a former Duffryn High School student, in January. In a tribute, her mother Emma O’Donoghue wrote that Xana was an ‘unusual name for a unique and beautiful girl’. Before the crash, Miss Doyle, from Newport, had recently begun working at Wetherspoons as a cook and was also a trained beautician after completing an apprenticeship. Ms O’Donoghue said yesterday: ‘No sentence will ever give me back my daughter or my children their sister. She is dearly missed and this terribly traumatic experience will remain with us for ever. ‘I am pleased that Sakhawat Ali has pleaded guilty, not that he could dispute any of the evidence presented. Miss Doyle suffered a 'blunt head injury' and was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales . Ali was remanded in custody and a hearing in July will determine if his cousin also contributed to the crash . ‘Xana was a beautiful, funny and loving girl and every day is a struggle to live on without her in our lives, we can only hope that justice is served and those responsible are held accountable.’ Paying tribute to Miss Doyle at her funeral, her mother said: ‘You had a smile that would stop this world spinning around. ‘I always knew that you were kind and loving and even through your difficult teenage years you never forgot to tell me how much you loved me and appreciated my support. ‘In the last two years you blossomed into a beautiful young woman, independent and hard-working, making us all so proud of you.’ She added that she had fond memories of her daughter playing and fooling around with her sisters, Lauren and Eve, and her brother Zane. Miss Doyle, whose white coffin was adorned with red roses, gave ‘unquivering friendship and support’ to her friends and family throughout her life, her mother added.

A young woman has managed to find her doppelgänger after launching a campaign on Facebook as a social experiment - and their likeness is mind-blowing. Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old  TV presenter from Dublin, teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed Twin Strangers to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days, and were soon inundated with submissions from all over the world. Incredibly, Niamh found her match in Karen Branigan, 29, a fellow Ireland native who lives just an hour down the road, making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together. Scroll down for video . Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Speaking to MailOnline about her first meeting with Karen, Niamh said: I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the entire duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face, and some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, "Oh my God that’s my face." 'I can’t remember the number of times I said "this is so freaky". It was truly amazing.' Karen, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Niamh has a brother and two sisters, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Niamh said the pair got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities.

'I knew what search I was embarking on. I’m the weirdo that contacted Karen out of the blue and asked her to meet me in person.' Since meeting, Niamh and Karen - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly'.

'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry says. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!'

They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' Niamh states. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?'

It may have been invented for students to use. But youngsters appear to be deserting Facebook in droves because it is now so popular with their parents – and grandparents. Almost a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’. The trend comes as increasing numbers of older users turn to the social network to stay in touch and share family pictures. Nearly 60 per cent of Britons aged over 55 now have a Facebook account, according to research. Facebook has even started running television adverts to entice the so-called ‘silver surfers’ to join. Now a survey of around 2,000 Britons has revealed that it is having the opposite effect on youngsters. ‘As parents are signing up, their children are logging off to maintain privacy,’ said Lord Jim Knight, chairman of online lobby group the Tinder Foundation. In the poll, a third of Facebook users are said to have blocked a family member so they can no longer see their account or do not receive automatic updates. The survey did not take account of the number of youngsters who have effectively blocked their family members by refusing to add them as a ‘Facebook friend’ in the first place. One in ten people aged 16 to 34 signed up to other platforms so they could remain ‘under the radar of their parents’. But whilst youngsters may be leaving Facebook, they are not giving up on social media altogether. More than half said they had joined Twitter, where only 13 per cent of ‘silver surfers’ said they have accounts. Meanwhile, about 40 per cent of youngsters use the picture-sharing website Instagram, according to the study commissioned by Halifax and carried out by Opinium Research. Logging off: Nearly a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their facebook accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’ Around the same proportion use Snapchat, a social media platform which automatically deletes messages shortly after they are sent. The picture was very different among the over-55s. Just three percent have an Instagram account and even fewer – around one percent – use Snapchat. The way people use these different social platforms is also changing. Around a fifth of those aged 16 to 34 use their smartphones at family dinners, posing a threat to the precious mealtimes that used to be the cornerstone on family life. By comparison, just one percent of silver surfers use their smartphones during a meal with their offspring.

Alan Pardew has warned Crystal Palace's Barclays Premier League admirers that if they want to sign Yannick Bolasie this summer then the bidding will have to start at £20million. It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.' Bolasie scores against Sunderland as he helped Crystal Palace beat the struggling Premier League side .

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini accepts his side are now facing a fight to stay in the Champions League places. City appear to have lost too much ground to Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race and their recent form has led to a further worry, with the sides behind them catching fast. The fading champions could even find themselves in fourth place before they next play - at Crystal Palace on Monday - if results go against them over the weekend. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) shakes hands with David Silva during Manchester City training . Martin Demichelis (left), Wilfried Bony (centre) and Fernando during Friday's session . Frank Lampard (right) looks to play a pass as he and his team-mates are put through their paces . This is not a battle they envisaged having to fight at the start of the campaign but Pellegrini realises nothing can be taken for granted after a frustrating second half of the season. Pellegrini said: 'I think in this league you can never be sure you are going to have a Champions League place. You have six or seven teams that, from the beginning, all of them play for that position. 'At the moment, for the whole year, we have been in a position of the Champions League. I hope that we will continue.' Pellegrini believes his side are now in a battle for the Champions League places and not the title . Manchester City have struggled to keep up with Chelsea, who are closing in on the Premier League trophy . The ramifications of dropping out of the top four, however, are not really something Pellegrini wants to consider, given that he still has hopes of landing the title. With just eight games remaining and a significant deficit to make up on Chelsea that looks a forlorn task, but Pellegrini is not giving up. The Chilean said: 'Of course if we want to continue in the first position of the table we must not drop any more points. It is easy to say but not easy to do it. 'We just know that from now until the end of the season we will try to win all the games and we will see if we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end.' Sergio Aguero has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks but will hope to find the net on Monday . James Milner is in line to return after withdrawing from the England squad with a knee problem . City will hope to be at full strength for the trip to Selhurst Park. Pellegrini reported nothing other than 'small problems' when asked about any injury concerns at his pre-match press conference. That means a likely return for key midfielder Yaya Toure, who missed the 3-0 victory over West Brom a fortnight ago with an Achilles problem but has since played for Ivory Coast. Fellow midfielder James Milner has also been troubled by a knee problem in recent weeks - and withdrew from England's midweek friendly in Italy - but the issue is not thought serious.

Radamel Falcao could still sign permanently for Manchester United after it emerged that chief executive Ed Woodward held talks with Monaco on Sunday over the striker’s future. Falcao, who has scored just four times for United since his season-long loan move from Monaco, drew another blank at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea on Saturday evening. But Woodward told Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev last Sunday that they would make a decision on the right to sign him permanently at the end of the season. Manchester United could sign Radamel Falcao permanently after holding talks with Monaco on Sunday . The striker has endured a frustrating season on loan at Man United and has managed just four league goals . Vasilyev said: ‘I saw the Manchester United people last Sunday and they have not yet decided if they would exercise the option.. ‘It’s not his best season, but they kept the opportunity to make a decision at the end of the season.’ Although it seems highly unlikely that United will keep the Colombian striker, Falcao has been given hope of a second chance under Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Under the terms of the original loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the forward, but it has since emerged that Monaco are willing to negotiate on the transfer fee after a disappointing season at United. Vasilyev added: ‘We are not in any other negotiations, even if big clubs are interested. The decision is with Manchester, then we will discuss with the player what he wants. I would like to have more visibility.’ Falcao missed last summer’s World Cup in Brazil following a knee injury and it is thought he rushed his recovery in an attempt to play in the tournament for Colombia. Under the terms of the loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the striker but Monaco are willing to negotiate . Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward spoke with Monaco president Vasim Vasilyev on Sunday . Vasilyev added: ‘He had mishaps in Monaco. He had problems with the coach Claudio Ranieri, there was a lack of understanding. ‘He was also seriously injured and missed the World Cup. In late August, he came to tell us that he wanted to play at a higher level.” Ranieri has since been replaced by Leonardo Jardim and he has backed Falcao to rediscover his goalscoring form after a frustrating season at United. Jardim, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Juventus in the Stade Louis II, is preparing for his return at the end of the season. Jardim, speaking ahead of his side's home clash with Juventus, is confident Falcao can get back to his best . The Portuguese coach said: ‘He’s not had a great season that is true, but I’m sure he can come back to the levels he was at in the past - that much I’m convinced about. ‘It’s not a question for me, but for the players, I’ve only worked with him for a month.’ Monaco lost the first leg last week in the Juventus Stadium to a controversial penalty and face Massimiliano Allegri’s team in the second leg.

An aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed Germanwings passenger plane may had its electronics 'hacked' before it crashed killing all 150 on board. The theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected Financial Times newspaper from aviation boss Matt Andersson, president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace. The French Alps tragedy which occurred on the flight between Barcelona to Dusseldorf has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28. He is believed to have barricaded himself in the cockpit of the GermanWings A320 Airbus before flying the packed plane into the mountainside as the captain fought desperately to get inside. Scroll down for video . Disaster: An aviation expert says an external factor like 'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the Germanwings plane crash that claimed 150 lives . Tragedy: The crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who investigators say locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet . Investigation: But Matt Andersson - president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace - says any number of causes could have caused the crash . Doomed: Recordings from the cockpit suggested that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (left) locked himself in the cockpit while the Captain Patrick Sondenheimer desperately tried to break in . Investigators point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer. Mr Andersson says the French accident investigators are clear that the stricken plane 'accelerated in its descent'. But he writes in the FT: 'That may be, but it could be from any number of causes, including external electronic hacking into the aircraft's control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception.' 'This is one reason military and head-of-state aircraft are generally installed with specific shielding and additional active protective measures,' and he stresses: 'Civilian aircraft are not.' Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries and come to a firm conclusion. He added: 'The public should patiently wait for a through, multi-party professional air safety investigation, while maintaining an independence of judgment over preliminary official hypotheses.' Setting out his doubts about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary findings, Mr Andersson said: 'Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) of the Germanwings flight 9525 have yet to be subject to international standards. 'Until they are, many broad assertions currently presented to the public may turn out to be erroneous, misleading or in some cases lead to improper or counterproductive regulatory and other reactions –including misplaced liability, financial and insurance claims.' Damaged: Despite revelations from the plane's flight data recorders (pictured), Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries . Aftermath: He claims passenger planes do not have the same level of protection as military jets and someone could have hacked into its 'control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception' Since the crash, European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck, requiring a member of cabin crew to step in if one of the two pilots leaves the cockpit. Mr Andersson writes in the FT that the 'slow drip' of piecemeal judgments from preliminary assessments of data can be counterproductive. He said the European Cockpit Association representing nearly 40,000 professional pilots 'has rightly criticised the premature release' of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder. Investigators say this highlights the co-pilot breathing while locked in the cockpit while the pilot beats on the door outside. Protection: Since the crash which is believed to be caused by 28-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck . Police carried out forensic searches on Lubitz's and his parents house after it emerged that he 'deliberately' crashed the Airbus A320 jet into the Alps . He believes premature release 'could arguably prejudice a formal technical assessment' and Mr Andersson is not the only aviation expert to speculate on the plane being 'hacked'. Former commercial pilot Jay Rollins told US television channel MSNBC last month: 'This aircraft is highly computerised. 'There's one possibility that no-one has brought up. I wonder – could this be a hacking incident?' He drew parallels with the loss of a US drone over Iran, which some blamed on electronic hacking: 'Suddenly the aircraft responding to outside forces. 'If something like that were going on it would be very disturbing for the pilot.'

Lindsay Lohan has been living in London for the past year and says she likes it so much, she doesn't see herself returning to the States any time soon. The 28-year-old flame-haired beauty recently spent a stint on the stage, starring in a West End production of David Mamet’s Speed The Plow - for which she received lukewarm reviews - and seems intent on remaining in the UK for the foreseeable future. ‘[London] feels like home, I miss it every time I have to leave for work and can’t wait to get back,’ Lindsay told Homme Style Magazine while posing for a stunning and seductive shoot for the publication. ‘I go back to NYC and LA for family and work.’ Scroll down for video . Staying put: Lindsay Lohan says she feels 'at home' in London and has no plans to return to the States just yet . Fleur Du Mal Leather Corset . Available at Forward by Elyse Walker . Visit site . We haven't heard much from Lindsay in the US since she moved across the pond to London. But if her latest photo shoot for Homme Style magazine is any indication, she's making a comeback in a major way. The Mean Girls star showed of her svelte figure in a series of racy ensembles by Moschino and Agent Provacateur. Here she poses wearing nothing but a Fleur Du Mal leather corset, La Perla panties, and a pair of Moschino gloves. Corsets were hot on the Spring runways at Givenchy and Versace and continue to be a wardrobe staple for sultry celebs like Madonna and Kim Kardashian. Lindsay's leather number is available to purchase for just under $1,000. That's quite a big budget for lingerie, so we've come up with some alternatives that are less pricey but still have major sex appeal. Style them with a pencil skirt and blazer on your next night out and all eyes will be on you. Jezebel Embrace Strapless Corset at JCPenney . Visit site .

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same "situations" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'

Designer Lilly Pulitzer's family learned that it's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the 'Pink Sunday' rush for the late Ms Pulitzer’s eponymous brand’s brightly-colored, limited edition collaboration at Target. The 250-piece Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the #LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party .

Protesters have demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons during a protest against the gentrification of South London. The store front of its Brixton branch was covered in shattered glass while 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' was spray painted in black across their housing advertisements. A police spokesman confirmed that one man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Thousands of people turned up for the event organised by the Reclaim Brixton group who were demonstrating against local residents and businesses being priced out of the trendy area. One of the event's organisers denounced the violent actions of 'one idiot' but told MailOnline there could be a reason Foxtons - which has a reputation for selling expensive homes - has been 'continuously targeted'. Scroll down for video . Vandal: One vandal smashed the front window of Foxtons Brixton branch (pictured) during a 'wholly peaceful' protest against rising house prices in London . Violent: The lone protester demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons, who have a reputation for selling expensive houses . Defaced: The vandal then spray painted 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' on the estate agent's housing advertisements . Reputation: A spokesperson for Reclaim Brixton - who organised the event - denounced the man's violent actions but suggested there could be a reason Foxtons is 'continuously targeted' Motive: Cyndi Anaso said she is not happy about the vandalism but told MailOnline 'it suggests there's a reason they are being targeted' Response: Police at the scene in Brixton (pictured) had to us CS spray to disperse a group of violent protesters . Cyndi Anaso from Reclaim Brixton told MailOnline said she was 'saddened' that someone behaved 'deviantly' during a wholly peaceful demonstration. But she claims the upmarket estate agents have been targeted before, adding: 'Foxtons has a very poor reputation when it comes to expensive properties and unfortunately.' 'There's a message in it which I'm not happy about but it still suggests there's a reason they are being targeted. 'There's never an endorsement of the attack but nothing else on the day can be considered even slightly violent.' 'I don't even think it's right to apologise for these individuals because every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window.' Foxtons is widely considered as a sign of gentrification and its presence is an indicates that an area either is or has the potential to become very affluent. The Reclaim Brixton event was planned to demonstrate against the rising property prices in London which the group believes is 'displacing the city's communities'. A statement on the Facebook page for the event said: 'The fight against gentrification starts here! Brixton is widely known for its vibrancy, which is another word for social and cultural diversity. Keeping watch: There is still a 'police presence' outside the vandalised store in Brixton, South London following the incident . Defence: Sympathisers and Brixton locals used Twitter to condemn the attention being given to the 'isolated' act of vandalism . Break-in: The Metropolitan Police (pictured) also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall, but were removed shortly after and no arrests were made . 'But Brixton's vibrancy now has a question mark on it. Will Brixton turn into a living museum or will it live?' But alongside images of people protesting peacefully on the streets, social media has been flooded with images of hordes pushing past police and the Foxtons window being destroyed. A police spokesman added: 'A group of protesters then made their way to Brixton Road where the window of a commercial premises was smashed and graffiti sprayed on the building.' Police used CS spray on 'a small group of protesters' who went into Brixton Police Station at around 4.10pm before being removed shortly afterwards. The Metropolitan Police also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall at around 3.15pm, saying: 'Officers entered the building and the protesters were removed.' Grace Lally from Lambeth Housing Activists said the demonstration had attracted thousands of people. Smashed: A Reclaim Brixton spokesperson said: 'Every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window' She added: 'The protest has been lively and strong and loud and people have hung banners off the town hall, blocked the streets and marched through Brixton a number of times and stopped traffic.' Ms Lally insisted the protest was 'really lively' but there had been 'no violence or trouble or anything like that'. Those sympathetic to Reclaim Brixton's protest and locals of the area have taken to Twitter to denounce isolated incidents of violence. Regarding the smashed window, Vanessa Furey from London said: 'Whilst sympathetic to the sentiment, idiots who have done this will have taken away what Reclaim Brixton was about.' And Louise Ridley wrote: 'I live in Brixton. I want people to know about extortionate rents and evictions. But I don't want windows smashed, anywhere.'

(CNN)Pushed to his limits, a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class. In an email to his students, Irwin Horwitz accused them of "backstabbing, game playing, cheating, lying, fighting." The professor at the Texas A&M University Galveston Campus expected his missive would create some conflict, but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly. Those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage. The story went viral. Suddenly, his name was spreading on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, accompanied by the kind of strong, unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you've never met. He was a hero who taught today's entitled youth a much-needed lesson, or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit. One thing was certain: He, and his employer, were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for. "I did what I did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the Internet," Horwitz said. "I will stand by what I did, but I'm not career suicidal." Texas A&M says Horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching. But Horwitz, a nontenure-track professor in the maritime administration program, is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs. Horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial, and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class. The day before writing to his students, Horwitz wrote a similar email to the CEO of the Texas A&M Galveston Campus and to the school's chief academic officer. "I have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful, dishonest and disrespectful" as his current strategic management class, he wrote to the administrators. He accused the students of shirking responsibility, making excuses and complaining their way to better grades. He would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class, Horwitz wrote. "The class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic," he wrote. "But they are your problem now." It was the next day that Horwitz wrote to the students, calling the class "an embarrassment in general," and said that "I am frankly and completely disgusted." Once his words echoed in traditional and social media, the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone. The story was such a talker that even The Onion offered a parody. "I'm not looking to fail students," Horwitz said. "I don't get a bonus for failing students." "The letter sounded a little bit more definite than I wanted it to," he added. He never actually changed anyone's grade. There were some students he wasn't going to fail, he said, and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out. But Horwitz stands by his tough stance; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed, he said. The course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses. "I had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break-even analysis," the professor said. "If you cannot do a break-even analysis, then you don't deserve a bachelor's degree in business." His other complaint was about professionalism. Horwitz said students would swear at him, cheat and spread rumors about him online. This is related to their grades, he said, because dealing with people you don't like is a business skill. On online message boards, users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story. One purported student called Horwitz "a little obnoxious," but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules. Should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral? The fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public, but maybe there is more to it. The situation hits on a popular argument on the media and Internet: What do we think of millennials? Reflecting on his most recent class, Horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered. He mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics, and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration. The other factor is a failure of K-12 education, said Horwitz, who has met college students who don't know how to convert fractions to decimals. "What I'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance," he said. In a statement, Patrick Louchouarn, the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at Texas A&M Galveston Campus, said the entire class will not be failed. "Each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester," Louchouarn said. "The university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies." The flurry of attention is unwelcome and Horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia. But it's likely his story will have a short shelf life. People probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline. But he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere. He said he feels a public shaming of sorts. Online public shaming has become a research topic of its own. People who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance. "This is really destroying my life," Horwitz said.

Medical experts analyzed the movie Skyfall and concluded that James Bond would have died within the first seven minutes if he were a real person. The depleted uranium bullet that hit him would have likely killed him, and even if he survived, the radioactive nature of the ammunition would have increased his cancer risk. Throughout the movie, Bond faces multiple life-threatening situations, such as jumping from a speeding train and performing surgery on himself. Other action movies like Die Hard were also analyzed, with experts determining that the main characters would not have survived their ordeals. Tom Hanks' character in Cast Away was one of the few who could have plausibly survived on a desert island for four years, as long as he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash.

Equal Pay Day is a day marked by progressive women's groups to highlight the wage gap between men and women. However, the 77-cent wage gap statistic is overstated and doesn't account for important factors like education and profession. The Democratic women's agenda focuses on pay equity and fairness in the workplace, while Republicans should pay attention to the issue as well. The "war on women" narrative is still relevant, and both parties need to address the issue of pay equity in order to win over women voters. The Independent Women's Forum found that the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act increased support for the bill but did not necessarily increase support for Democrats. Conservatives should not ignore the issue of pay equity and need to be prepared to respond to it.

Freddie Gray broke his neck after falling head-first into the back of a police van as it was moving, according to a police investigation. The investigation found that Gray's injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt in the back door of the van, and there was no evidence he sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest. The van made a previously unreported stop, which was captured by a security camera, and Gray was standing without a seat belt on. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray should have been given medical help. The report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver. The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the van was rejected by his family's attorney. Outrage over Gray's death has prompted nationwide protests against police brutality. Gray grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west side and was poisoned by lead paint as a child. He had a troubled childhood and lived off a settlement from a lead poisoning lawsuit. The Sandtown neighborhood where Gray lived is predominantly African American and has high levels of poverty and unemployment.

Roseanne Barr, 62, revealed in an interview that she is going blind due to macular degeneration and glaucoma. These eye diseases get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors have not provided a timeline for her condition, but her symptoms are worsening.

The risk for both diseases increases after age 60, with some people at higher risk in their 40s. There is no cure for either disease, but treatments can delay progression or halt further vision loss. Simple ways to protect your eyes include wearing sunglasses, exercising regularly, eating leafy greens and vitamin-rich foods, and avoiding cigarette smoke.

A study led by the University of Montana found that eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements for recovery. Researchers observed that performance levels remained the same after consuming fast food or supplements during recovery periods between exercise sessions. Levels of glycogen, used by muscles as fuel, were slightly higher after consuming fast food as a recovery food. The study involved 11 male athletes who were asked to fast for 12 hours before a 90-minute endurance workout and were then given either fast food or supplements. Performance during a subsequent 12-mile stationary bike ride was similar for both groups, with no significant differences in insulin, glucose, or cholesterol levels. The researchers noted that the long-term effects of consuming fast food for workout recovery are still unknown, and the study had a small sample size.

During an expedition to Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula, Canadian tourist Charlene Fritz had a surprising encounter with a baby elephant seal. The seal, weighing around 200lbs and only two months old, approached Charlene on the beach and cuddled up to her. Despite wanting to hug the seal, Charlene followed regulations that prohibited her from touching the pup. She described the seal as warm, boneless, and without a fishy smell. Charlene learned that elephant seal pups are abandoned by their mothers at one month old to learn how to fend for themselves. The encounter was captured on video by a friend, and Charlene later realized the seal's friendly behavior was due to the harsh weaning process. She explained that the pups are left on the beach to starve until they learn to fish in the ocean. While the baby seal was affectionate, encounters with full-grown elephant seals can be dangerous, as males can weigh up to two tonnes and have aggressive behavior during mating season.

Medical experts analyzed the movie Skyfall and concluded that James Bond would have died within the first seven minutes if he were a real person. The depleted uranium bullet that hit him would have likely killed him, and even if he survived, the radioactive nature of the ammunition would have increased his cancer risk. Throughout the film, Bond faces numerous life-threatening situations, including jumping from a speeding train and performing surgery on himself. Other action movies, such as Die Hard and Home Alone, were also analyzed, with similar conclusions reached about the survival chances of the main characters. Tom Hanks' character in Cast Away was deemed to have a plausible chance of surviving on a desert island for four years, as long as he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash. Overall, the experts found that many action movie heroes would not have survived their on-screen adventures if they were real people.

Researchers have found that people tend to get along better and feel happier and more relaxed when having conversations over a meal. A study conducted by Dutch and Canadian scientists showed that participants felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments, and were more likely to make compromises when eating with someone else. The study also found that hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children during mealtime conversations. One possible explanation for this is that chewing raises levels of the 'feel-good' brain chemical serotonin. The researchers suggest that having difficult conversations, such as with a boss or partner, may be easier to navigate over a meal. However, they caution that meals may not be the best idea for a first date, as it can be difficult to come up with enough conversation for strangers.

The disabled fans argue that the improved offering, including a programme, parking, and access to executive bars, is useless to them as they are in wheelchairs. The Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association has expressed disgust with the club's actions, claiming they are being pushed into less desirable seating areas. City defends their actions by stating they want to provide the same offering to all supporters and have increased the number of disabled bays and invested in improving facilities.

Former sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele is on trial for the shooting deaths of his wife and sister-in-law, whom he described in a suicide note as his threesome partners.

Medical experts analyzed the movie Skyfall and concluded that James Bond would have died within the first seven minutes if he were a real person. The depleted uranium bullet that hit him would have likely killed him, and even if he survived, the radioactive nature of the ammunition would have increased his cancer risk. Throughout the film, Bond faces numerous life-threatening situations, including jumping from a speeding train and performing surgery on himself. Other action movies, such as Die Hard and Home Alone, were also analyzed for their characters' survival chances. Tom Hanks' character in Cast Away was deemed to have a plausible chance of surviving on a desert island for four years, as long as he escaped the plane crash relatively unscathed.

Researchers have found that people get along better and feel happier and more relaxed when having a meal together. Participants in a study reported feeling friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments, and were more likely to make compromises during meals. Hierarchies between bosses and employees and adults and children also broke down during mealtime. Chewing food may raise levels of the 'feel-good' brain chemical serotonin, which could explain why people feel happier during meals. Difficult conversations may be easier to have over a meal, as shared meals enhance our desire to be accepted and please others. However, meals may not be the best idea for a first date, as it may be difficult to come up with enough conversation.

Medical experts analyzed the movie Skyfall and concluded that James Bond would have died within the first seven minutes if he were a real person. The depleted uranium bullet that hit him would have likely killed him, and even if he survived, the radioactive nature of the ammunition would have increased his cancer risk. Throughout the movie, Bond faces various life-threatening situations, such as jumping from a speeding train and performing surgery on himself. Other action movies like Die Hard were also analyzed, with experts determining that the main characters would not have survived their ordeals. Tom Hanks' character in Cast Away, however, could have plausibly survived on a desert island for four years if he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash. Overall, the experts found that many action movie heroes would not have survived their on-screen adventures in real life.

Researchers have found that people feel happier and more relaxed when having difficult conversations over a meal. A study conducted by Dutch and Canadian scientists showed that participants felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments, and were more likely to make compromises while eating. Hierarchies between bosses and employees and adults and children also broke down during mealtime conversations. Chewing food may raise levels of the 'feel-good' brain chemical serotonin, making conversations easier. The study suggests that discussing tricky topics over a meal can be beneficial, as shared meals enhance our desire to be accepted and please others. However, the effect of sharing a meal may be different among strangers, as meals can be lengthy and new acquaintances may struggle to come up with enough conversation.

An Old Bailey judge criticized his junior colleague for giving a suspended sentence to a BT manager involved in a £28,000 expenses scam. Christopher Starrs and another manager, Phillip Tamplin, submitted fake claims for clamped cars, overtime hours, and property damage during broadband installation. Tamplin was jailed for two years, but Starrs was spared jail and ordered to repay the money and pay a fine. However, Judge Nicholas Cooke QC deemed the sentence unlawful and said Starrs should have been sent to prison. The judge criticized the barristers for not pointing out the sentencing error and said the judge should have been aware of his powers. The main fraudulent claim was for clamped BT vehicles, and Starrs has already repaid the stolen money. The confiscation proceedings were dropped, and the original sentence stands. Recorder Trimmer described the fraud as sophisticated and involving over 100 false claims. Starrs, who had worked at BT since 1988, was excused from sitting in the dock due to being in a wheelchair.

A Ukip candidate named Kim Rose is being investigated by police for allegedly trying to influence voters by giving them sausage rolls at an event in Southampton. Electoral Commission rules state that providing food and entertainment to influence votes is a criminal offense known as 'treating'. Mr. Rose, who called the police involvement 'absolutely ridiculous', claims that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to change their minds for a sausage roll. He has been a member of Ukip since 1999 and is campaigning on tackling deprivation in Southampton and pulling the UK out of the EU. The event in question took place more than a month before Parliament was officially dissolved and featured snooker star Jimmy White playing pool with residents. Ukip leader Nigel Farage has backed Mr. Rose, calling the allegations 'utter nonsense'. The Electoral Commission has stated that treating requires a corrupt intent and anyone found guilty can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. The police are currently looking into the complaint, but no arrests have been made.

A husband was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock after his wife suffered a botched surgery that left her looking like the Michelin man. Julie Ronayne was awarded £160,000 for the bungled hysterectomy in 2008, while her husband Edward was awarded £9,000 for the psychiatric injury he suffered from seeing his wife's appearance. The severe swelling was caused by peritonitis, a dangerous infection contracted during the surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The NHS is fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could set a precedent for similar claims. The case is being heard at the Appeal Court, with the judges reserving their decision on the appeal. The husband described the incident as the worst days of his life and had not fully recovered from the shock. The NHS argues that the husband did not suffer enough shock to qualify for compensation and that the ruling could lead to a flood of similar claims, costing the organization millions.

Researchers have found that people tend to get along better and feel happier and more relaxed when having a meal together. A study conducted by Dutch and Canadian scientists showed that participants felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments, and were more likely to make compromises when eating with someone else. The study also found that hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children during mealtime. One possible explanation for this is that chewing raises levels of the 'feel-good' brain chemical serotonin. The researchers suggest that difficult conversations, such as those with bosses or children, may be best tackled over a meal. However, they caution that meals may not be the best idea for a first date, as it can be difficult to come up with enough conversation for strangers.

Equal Pay Day is a day marked by progressive women's groups to highlight the wage gap between men and women.

The Independent Women's Forum conducted an experiment that showed support for pay equity legislation did not necessarily translate to support for Democrats. The article concludes by urging conservatives to not ignore the issue of pay equity and be prepared to respond to the narrative pushed by the left.

The Australian government has announced a new policy called "no jab, no pay" which will remove exemptions for conscientious objectors to vaccinations starting in January 2016. Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children could lose up to $11,000 in welfare benefits a year. The government estimates that more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated due to their parents' objections. Existing exemptions for medical or religious reasons will continue, but guidelines for religious exemptions will be tightened. The policy is in response to the increasing number of children in Australia who have not received immunizations against diseases like measles. Anti-vaccination campaigns have gained traction in Western countries, despite the widely discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. The announcement has sparked opposition, with over 7,000 people signing a petition against the reforms.

Researchers have found that people get along better and feel happier and more relaxed when having a meal together. This was observed in nearly 100 men and women who filled out questionnaires after spending at least five minutes talking to someone else. Participants felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments, and were more likely to make compromises during meals. Hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. Chewing food may raise levels of the 'feel-good' brain chemical serotonin, which could explain why people feel happier during meals. Difficult conversations may be easier to have over a meal, as shared meals enhance our desire to be accepted and please others. However, meals may not be ideal for first dates, as they can be lengthy and strangers may struggle to come up with enough conversation.
